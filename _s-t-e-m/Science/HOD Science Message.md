#### HOD's Message

As a parent and an educator, I always believe that every child has different readiness and talent, and when given the opportunity and the right approach, they can learn, grow and succeed in their life.

Given the diverse changing global landscape, students with diverse learning needs and aptitudes for Science, and in alignment with the school’s vision “Active learners, Responsible Citizens” the department hopes to:

* encourage Bendemeerians to apply the knowledge, skill sets and competencies gained in Science to make responsible and well-informed decision in their daily lives to solve problems, and contribute to the society, to improve self and others
* provide all Bendemeerians with a good foundations in Science learning and excite them in the pursue of STEM related work
* inculcate desire Values and attitudes of life such as Resilience, Integrity, Curiosity and responsibility through role-modelling and the key attributes of Scientists

To achieve the department’s goals, the approaches and programme were tiered for our Bendemeerians.

* Lower secondary science – focus on enthusing and growing their passion and interest in science through application, exploration in science and STEM, growing their scientific literacy and develop strong foundation in the different discipline of science
* Upper secondary science – subject mastery in the respective discipline of science, with in-depth application of scientific concept for innovation driven by problem solving of authentic issue, exposure to develop interdisciplinary thinking through STEM

Our approach in teaching and learning of science focuses much on inquiry-based learning through the use of varied resources and strategies such as phenomenon sharing and discussion, demonstration, questioning, and hands-on activity to get students to explore and discover further, to engage and enrich their learning. The use of department-based study skills such as note-taking and concept mapping were introduced to students to help them connect the concepts in science, leading to better appreciation and relevance of science learning.

We use of authentic and novel context for students to apply their learning to demonstrate understanding and integration of skills and knowledge in problem solving within and across different disciplines. This interdisciplinary learning allows students to develop and apply skills and knowledge in a range of subjects and be more able to appreciate the complexity of real-world problems. To meet the diverse needs of our students, the science department also adopted differentiated instructions to better engage and meet the learning needs of our students. This includes class activities with varied level of demands through tiering and scaffolding, work assignments and type of questions used. In addition, to stretch different groups of learners and expand their horizon, students are invited to participate in competitions and enrichment activities held by tertiary institutions/ external organisation. To further provide opportunities for our students to showcase their learning and excite our school community in science learning, our annual science week focus on science application and interdisciplinary learning in our daily lives.

Globalisation, changing demographics and technological advancements are some of the key driving forces shaping our future. We need to adapt quickly in response and prepare our students to face these challenges and seize the opportunities brought about by these forces. To prepare our students for this uncertainty, the department also leverages on various online platforms and tools to enhance the learning of science and infusing e-pedagogy. With the introduction of personal learning devices (PLDs), this enhances our approach to integrate the department pedagogy on IBL with Technology.

Through the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in health science and healthcare technology, our tier 1 programme provides foundation and platform for our students to explore learning beyond the curriculum and apply their learning through technology to solve authentic problems. This provides an edge for our students in practice and enhance problem solving and the understanding of current healthcare issues facing Singapore and innovate for the betterment of others in their little ways.

Through the above mentioned, we develop our Bendemeerians to be ‘Active learners, Responsible Citizens’ who can handle the uncertainty and fast changing landscape to be active in making responsible decisions to solve problems, and instill belief in them to unleash their potential, “From Each His Best”.
