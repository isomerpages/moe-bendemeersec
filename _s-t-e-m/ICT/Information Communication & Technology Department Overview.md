# Information Communication & Technology Department Overview

### VISION AND MISSION 

**Vision** 

Enriching students’ learning experiences through the responsible use of ICT.

**Mission** 

To provide opportunities for every student to appreciate, use and apply ICT.

**Our Key Programmes**

**Basic Programming – Code for Fun Programme (Secondary 1 & 2)**

The objective of this programme is to increase students’ exposure to coding and computational thinking through a fun and interactive manner. Students will first learn about basic coding using the Scratch coding software before getting hands-on experience with the mBots.

The mBot is a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) education robot which allows students to learn about a variety of robotic machinery and electronic parts, get to grips with the fundamentals of block-based programming, and develop their logical thinking and design skills.

The programme is carried out progressively over 2 years; Secondary 1 students will go through 10 hours of basic coding training and another 10 hours of working with the robotics aspect when they go up to Secondary 2 in the following year.
 
**ICT Exposure: Competitions & Workshops (Secondary 3)**

As part of the school’s continuing efforts in Education and Career Guidance (ECG), the ICT department started exposing Secondary 3 students to various ICT-related competitions and workshops in 2018.
These include the National Software Competition and the Youth Cyber Exploration Programme, which also provide an edge for participants in the Early Admission Exercise (EAE) should they fulfil certain criteria from the competition/workshop.
