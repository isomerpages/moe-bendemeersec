## **Music**
**Lower Secondary Music Education**

<p style="text-align:justify">The music programme in Bendemeer Secondary School is aligned with MOE’s Desired Outcome of Education and The Framework for 21CC. Music lessons include instrumental learning, listening, composing, creating, performing, appreciation and understanding of global and local musical cultures. The main instruments that our students will learn are the recorder and the ukulele. Besides learning general musical elements and concepts, students listen to different genres of music to cultivate their life-long appreciation for music. Through music project works, they develop their skills to communicate, collaborate, and be an active and self-directed learner. Their performances in class create opportunities to train them to become a confident person, and also develop their critical thinking and observation skills by giving judgement and comments on their peers’ performance.</p>
