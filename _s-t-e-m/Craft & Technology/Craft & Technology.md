# Craft & Technology

![Mrs Sharon Wee: HOD Craft and Tech](/images/mrs-sharon-wee-212x300.jpg)

Art, Design & Technology (D&T), Food and Consumer Education/Nutrition and Food Science (FCE/NFS), Elements of Business Studies (EBS) and Music are the subjects under the purview of the Craft and Technology Department. We are firm believers that the study of these elective subjects will provide students with a balanced and well-rounded education, develop them to the fullest potential and nurture them into life-long learners and good citizens. To promote civic mindedness of being responsible citizens, the department’s experiential learning programmes provide opportunities for students to work in teams and show empathy to others. Through these learning processes, students learn to be creative and develop an inquiring mind.

We want to develop students to be Active Learners when they live out the spirit of learning for life, constantly challenging assumptions and seeking better ways of doing things through participation, creativity and innovation. The elective subjects offer opportunities to discover the world of business, arts and music, as well as developing life skills. They also enable students to deepen their appreciation of the arts and music.

We believe that when students are motivated to learn, they will be able to contribute to the nation’s success and become responsible citizens. Within the department, we believe that the learning experiences gleaned from the elective subjects will strengthen their understanding of school values (Respect, Resilience, Responsibility, Integrity, Care and Harmony) and the 21st Century Competencies. These will help students to thrive in a fast changing world.

The study of Design & Technology is built on experiential learning, with emphasis on understanding everyday activities and creating possibilities to make life better. The study of Art provides students with the skills, concepts and knowledge necessary for them to express their responses to ideas and experiences in a visual or tactile form. The study of Food and Consumer Education focuses on developing knowledge, skills and attitudes related to health, lifestyles and consumer trends. Through these elective subjects, we hope that the diverse skills and knowledge acquired will prepare our students to be future ready.

The study of Music provides students with opportunities to develop a connection to music which contributes to the development and preservation of Singapore’s cultural heritage. The study of EBS provides an introduction to business through an understanding of business activities, focusing on basic marketing and customer relations, in the context of Singapore.

In the process of learning elective subjects, students will become Active learners through authentic learning experiences and constructing knowledge themselves. In becoming confident learners, students will appreciate diverse views, adapt to changes and communicate effectively with peers and teachers.  We believe that through the rich learning experiences of elective subjects, students will be able to become Active Learners and Responsible Citizens.
