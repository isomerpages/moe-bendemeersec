<p style="text-align:justify">In Bendemeer Secondary School we believe in developing our students to be active learners and responsible citizens, who are confident visual learners. The Art Unit aims to cultivate in our students the love for the visual arts through the development of artistic skills in observation, creative expression and appreciation of varied art forms in both the lower and upper secondary levels.</p>

#### **Lower Secondary Art Curriculum**

<p style="text-align:justify">The Art Unit at Bendemeer Secondary School aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to be discerning visual learners who are not only creative but effective communicators, critical-thinkers and problem-solvers - competencies that are important for the 21st Century. It also aims to develop students’ learning that focuses on context, artistic process, media and visual qualities through making and learning about artworks. </p>
 
The art programme focuses on helping students:
 
* <p style="text-align:justify">Understand and apply effectively the elements of art and principles of design in their art-making</p>
* Appreciate and develop an understanding of various art forms.
* <p style="text-align:justify">Inquire about their learning via exploration of meaning-making, materials, processes and techniques.</p>
* <p style="text-align:justify">Develop positive attitudes and values on how they can relate their artworks to real-life contexts</p>
* Express themselves freely and creatively.
* Sharpen their senses through keen observation of the environment.
 
<p style="text-align:justify">Students are assessed using both formative and summative assessments through task and project-based assignments.</p>
 
##### **Sec 1 Arts Education Programme** 

This programme is a collaboration between the Craft and Technology department and the CCE department. The Sec 1 Arts Education Programme is based on ethnic themes for students to learn various cultural arts such as making the Ceramic tile painting, Batik painting, Metal tooling and Mask painting and created their masterpieces where a few were selected and exhibited at the Arts Education Gallery. Each class was given an ethnic group in the beginning of the year to focus on and students got to experience learning trails to Little India, Geylang Serai, Katong and Chinatown. These enriching learning journeys will develop students’ understanding of the ethnic themes and help them to prepare in terms of class decor to the layout of the classroom and performance towards the year end Appreciation Day for the school’s non-teaching staff.

#### **Upper Secondary Art Curriculum**

<p style="text-align:justify">The upper secondary art curriculum, which is offered as an elective subject, emphasizes both skills and thought processes such as research, exploration, development, experimentation and evaluation in the art-making process of artworks. Ample studio time spent enables students to explore and practise using varied media in their art-making. Through these learning experiences, the curriculum aims to develop students to:
Give form and meaning to their ideas, thoughts and feelings through visual and tactile forms.</p>

* Use a variety of media and technologies in their art-making processes.
* Maintain the development of critical and creative thinking.
* <p style="text-align:justify">Further enhance and develop visual literacy skills such as perceiving and responding to visual images and analysis of visual information of varied forms.</p>
* <p style="text-align:justify">Further inquire about their learning via their exploration of meaning-making, materials, processes and techniques.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The students are assessed using both formative and summative assessments through task assignments and mini-coursework.</p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify">The upper secondary art curriculum also enables students to have more exposure to the study of multiple international and local artists, modern and contemporary artists especially in the study of visual art - which is infused into their studio practice. With the artistic skills and knowledge that are introduced in-depth to the upper secondary art students, they are able to generate ideas more effectively and be well-prepared for the rigour of the GCE N & O Level Art examinations such as coursework, at secondary 4.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The students also get to experience various learning journeys to art supply stores, art exhibitions and museums as well as art tertiary institutions such as NAFA & LaSalle College of the Arts.  With such opportunities, upper secondary art students are able to gain exposure, and increase their appreciation and understanding of the art scene in Singapore.</p>
