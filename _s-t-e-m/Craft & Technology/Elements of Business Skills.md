## **Elements of Business Skills**

Elements of Business Skills (EBS) intends to provide students with opportunities to develop transferable employability skills and knowledge in the service industry, namely the Travel and Tourism, Hospitality, and Retail industries, which continue to offer employment opportunities accessible to the students. In the Elements of Business Skills (EBS) syllabus framework, the basic concepts of marketing and customer relations are at the core of the EBS syllabus. 

Over the years, we have brought students for experiential industrial attachments namely at the Hospitality Industry: Mandarin Oriental Hotel and Pan Pacific Hotel during the F1 season, Retail Industry such as Isetan at Serangoon Nex and Travel and Tourism Industry such as the Singapore Zoological Garden. In school, opportunities are created for students to be their own boss (BYOB) where they get to sell their products and services to the masses during recess and after school hours. 

**Upper Secondary EBS**

A combination of formative and summative assessments are meted out to assess studentsâ€™ application of knowledge and test them on their concepts learnt in EBS. These include a written paper (60%)  and coursework (40%). Coursework in secondary four will take up to 20 curriculum time over 10-14 weeks.
