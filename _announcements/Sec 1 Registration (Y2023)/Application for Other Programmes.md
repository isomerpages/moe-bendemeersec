If your child exhibits interest and passion for Art or Music, they can apply for Art Elective Programme (AEP) or Music Elective Programme (MEP) in the following Centres:

* AEP Centre (National Junior College)
* MEP Centres (Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) or Dunman High School)

Successful applicants will attend weekly lessons in the afternoon at the AEP/MEP Centres. In view of the extended Art/Music curriculum, AEP/MEP students will not be offered Design and Technology (D&T) and Food and Consumer Education (FCE) at the Lower Secondary level to ensure that their overall curriculum load is manageable.
