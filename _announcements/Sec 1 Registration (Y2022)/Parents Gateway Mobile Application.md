# Parents Gateway Mobile Application
Parents Gateway is a mobile application that connects parents and schools on key administrative matters, providing schools with the platform to send updates on programmes and activities to parents. At the same time, Parents Gateway allows parents to perform administrative functions such as providing consent for their children to participate in school activities and declaring travel plans.

Access to Parents Gateway is granted to parents, legal guardians and authorised caregivers of students studying in MOE schools in Singapore. Parents will need to use SingPass to access Parents Gateway. For more information on how to use Parents Gateway, please visit the [PG website](https://pg.moe.edu.sg/) or refer to the downloadable slides below.

Parents/Guardians who were on board Parents Gateway when your child/ward was in primary school do not have to download the Parents Gateway mobile app again when your child/ward progresses to secondary school.
