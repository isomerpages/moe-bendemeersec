## **Cyber-Security and Cyber wellness**

### Cyber Security

<p style="text-align:justify">A Device Management Application (“DMA”) will come pre-installed on all PLDs purchased through the school, and will be installed on all student-owned devices subject to parental/guardian consent. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The DMA has 3 main components which will support the use of the PLD in the classroom and safeguard students’ cyber wellness:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">(a)   Classroom Management Service. This enables teachers to manage the students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management and support effective teaching and learning.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">(b)   Mobile Device Management Service. This facilitates the updating and managing of the PLD, protects the PLD from malicious software, and protects students from objectionable internet content.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">(c)   Usage Management Service. This enables the school and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after school.</p>

### Cyber Wellness

<p style="text-align:justify">As Bendemeerians develop digital skills that support their learning, it is also imperative that they are empowered to take responsibility for their personal well-being when using technology.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The school adopts MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework to develop students into responsible digital citizens. Bendemeerian’s attitudes and behaviour on the use of technology are guided by the three Cyber Wellness Principles. These principles are constantly reinforced when students engage in the “Sense-Think-Act” process, which serves as a structure for them to use technology safely and meaningfully for their learning and interactions.</p>
