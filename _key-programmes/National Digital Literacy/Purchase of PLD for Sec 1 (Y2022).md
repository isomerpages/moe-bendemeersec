### The Personal Learning Device

<p style="text-align:justify">The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform – the Singapore Student Learning Space (“SLS”) – as well as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.  </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The school has made arrangements for parents/guardians to purchase the PLD from Acer Limited Pte Ltd for your child/ward’s use in school. The vendor has been identified based on the choice of device determined by the school from a panel of awarded suppliers established by MOE. The PLD bundle which includes warranty and insurance for purchase by your child/ward will be:</p>

### Use of Edusave

<p style="text-align:justify">MOE has provided Edusave top-ups of $200 in 2020 and in May 2021 to all eligible Singaporean students in primary and secondary schools. This is on top of the annual Edusave contribution of $290 for secondary students and $230 for primary students. Students who are Singapore citizens can use their Edusave to pay fully or partly for the PLD, after setting aside provision for payment of 2nd tier miscellaneous fees. Parents/Guardians can also choose to pay cash for the PLD.</p>

### Financial Assistance

<p style="text-align:justify">Subsidies are available for students who require funding support to purchase a PLD. Please note that it is compulsory for all students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) to use their Edusave to pay for the PLD, after subsidies have been granted. More information on the eligibility for the subsidy can be found in the Letter to Parents.</p>


### Software Applications

<p style="text-align:justify">Schools will progressively roll out IT applications that will be vital for students’ teaching and learning. These include:</p>

* <p style="text-align:justify">(a)   <b>Student iCON</b>: Every secondary school student will be provided with access to the Google Suite set of tools, including email address.</p>
* <p style="text-align:justify">(b)  <b>Microsoft ProPlus</b>: Every secondary school student will be able to use Microsoft Office tools that include Word, PowerPoint and Excel.</p>
* <p style="text-align:justify">(c)   <b>Zoom</b>: Every secondary school student will be given a Zoom free account with 40 min time limit for their video conferencing needs. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The school will need to use your child’s/ward’s full name, Student MIMS account and class to set up user accounts. Schools may also choose to roll out applications other than those listed above.</p>
