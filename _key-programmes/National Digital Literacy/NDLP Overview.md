<p style="text-align:justify">At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (“NDLP”) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (“PDLP”) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (“PLD”). This webpage provides important information about how you can purchase the PLD for your child/ward as well as about the accompanying applications that the school may be rolling out as part of the NDLP.</p>

### Intended Outcomes of the PLD Initiative

### Bendemeer’s Vision for the PLD Initiative

<p style="text-align:justify">The school aims to empower every Bendemeerian to be someone who actively seek to learn, be future-ready and possess the “can do” attitude while embracing the use of technology. All students will use technology as a means to stay passionate about learning, think critically and apply what they learnt to make decision and solve problems creatively for self and others.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Beyond the classroom, students will be able to use the device for home-based learning.  They can review past lessons, access digital resources on the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) platform and other digital platforms to enhance their learning, or explore topics of their own personal interests using the device.   Embedded digital tools in the PLD such as calendaring and note-taking applications can be used to enhance their personal productivity. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Through the learning experiences, students will be able to ‘find, think, apply and create’ through the mediated use of technology.</p>
