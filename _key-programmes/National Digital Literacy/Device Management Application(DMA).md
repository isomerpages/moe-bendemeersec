#### Functions of the DMA

<p style="text-align:justify">A Device Management Application (“DMA”) will come pre-installed on all PLDs purchased through the school, and will be installed on all student-owned devices subject to parental/guardian consent. The DMA has 3 main components which will support the use of the PLD in the classroom and safeguard students’ cyber wellness:  </p>


<p style="text-align:justify">(a)  <b>Mobile Device Management Service.</b> This facilitates the updating and managing of the PLD, protects the PLD from malicious software, and protects students from objectionable internet content.  </p>
  
<p style="text-align:justify">(b) <b>Classroom Management Service.</b> This enables teachers to manage the students’ use of the PLD during lesson time to improve classroom management and support effective teaching and learning.  </p>
  
<p style="text-align:justify">(c) <b>Usage Management Service.</b> This enables the school and/or parents/guardians to better supervise and set helpful limits for students’ use of PLD after school.</p>
