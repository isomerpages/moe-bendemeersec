# Acceptable Use Policy

**Bendemeer Secondary School <br>
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) <br>
For Personal Learning Device & School ICT Resources**

 

<p style="text-align:justify">Computing devices and access to the Internet have become a necessity for work, play and learning in the 21st century. As you navigate the digital space, you should do so in a safe and responsible manner. For more information, you may log in to SLS and refer to the Lesson “Student Kit on Cyber Wellness and Learning with a Personal Learning Device”.</p>

 

<p style="text-align:justify">In addition, you are reminded to observe the guidelines stated in this Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) on the use of personal learning devices (PLDs) and the school’s ICT resources. ICT resources include the following, but are not limited to, MOE/school-deployed ICT system accounts, the device management application (DMA) and school’s internet network.</p>

**General**

<p style="text-align:justify">1.  You are responsible for your PLD. In the event of loss or theft of the device, you must make a police report and report the matter to the school.</p>
   
<p style="text-align:justify">2.  In order to have a seamless learning experience, you should bring a fully charged PLD to school daily. </p>
  
<p style="text-align:justify">3.  All PLDs are installed with a device management application (DMA) to support a safe and conducive learning environment.  You should not attempt to uninstall the DMA or de-enroll the PLD from the DMA. Non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action in accordance with the school’s discipline policy.</p>
  
<p style="text-align:justify">4.  You should not attempt to access data, system and information that you are not authorised to.</p>
  
<p style="text-align:justify">5.  You are reminded that the use of PLDs and school’s ICT resources should solely be for the purpose of learning.
</p>

**User Account**

<p style="text-align:justify">6. You should interact with others in a respectful and responsible way. You should not post online remarks that are</p>
 
	* racially and/or religiously insensitive,
 
	* vulgar and/or offensive, or
 
	* hurtful to others.
 
<p style="text-align:justify">7.  You should not use any devices to</p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify">	*  store, modify, create or share content (e.g. documents, presentations, pictures and videos) that is inappropriate (e.g. indecent, pornographic, defamatory, hurtful to self or others).</p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify">	*  make threats, cause harassment or embarrassment, impersonate or intimidate others.</p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify">8. You should not use MOE/school-deployed ICT system accounts for any commercial activities (e.g. buying and selling of goods and services).</p>

**Intellectual Property**

<p style="text-align:justify">9. You are reminded to obtain explicit permission from the content owner before downloading, copying or sharing any copyrighted materials (e.g. pictures, videos, music).</p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify">10. You should not use, copy or share digital files in an unauthorised or illegal manner.</p>

**Taking care of your PLD**

<p style="text-align:justify">11.   You should report faulty PLD to your teacher or school ICT staff.  You may decide to send your PLD for repair through the school or on your own at the Service Centre.</p>
 
  For students whose PLDs are under repair, you may loan a PLD until your PLD is repaired and returned to you.</p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify">12.   The protective shell of the PLD will provide only basic protection from everyday use. You should use a carrying bag or a padded sleeve for your PLD.</p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify">13.   The touchscreen function also makes the screen particularly sensitive to damage from excessive pressure.</p>
 
		* Remove items (eg. pens, pencils) on the keyboard before closing the lid.
 
		* Do not place heavy objects on the Chromebook.
 
		* Do not jab at the screen with sharp objects.
 
 **Protection and Storing your PLD.**
 
<p style="text-align:justify">14.   Besides the mandatory labels which will have the school logo, your name and class, you may personalise your PLD on the cover with stickers, tape or labels.  You may also change your desktop wallpaper.</p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify">15.   You should keep your PLD in the class mobile cart with the **digital lock securely fastened** during PE or recess.  </p>
 
<p style="text-align:justify">16.   You should store your PLD into the metal cabinets during CCAs. Your CCA teachers-in-charge will provide the instructions to do so.</p>
