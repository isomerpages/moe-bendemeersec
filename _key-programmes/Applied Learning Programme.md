# Applied Learning Programme

### In Health Science and Healthcare technology

Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) seeks to deepen studentsâ€™ knowledge in STEM education where students solve authentic problems in health sciences and healthcare using technology. 

This programme consists of two tiers where Tier 1 is a broad-based programme for all lower secondary students and Tier 2 is a specialised programme for students who demonstrate a passion in STEM. The objective of the ALP is to give our students an opportunity to communicate effectively while collaborating with their peers to engineer innovative solutions that address the healthcare needs of the elderly in Singapore.

Our Tier 1 programme provides the foundation for all our Sec 1 and Sec 2 students to explore integrated learning beyond the curriculum and a platform for them to contribute actively back to our society. This provides an edge for our students to enhance their problem-solving skills and appreciate the current healthcare issues facing Singapore to drive the innovation for the betterment of others in their little ways.

Students will go through a series of lessons which uses the Inquiry approach, leveraging on the 3Es (Engage, Explore and Elaborate). The diagram below shows the timeline of lessons for our Sec 1 and Sec 2 students respectively.
