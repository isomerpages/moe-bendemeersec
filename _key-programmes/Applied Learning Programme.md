## **Applied Learning Programme In Health Science and Healthcare technology**

Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) seeks to deepen students’ knowledge in STEM education where students solve authentic problems in health sciences and healthcare using technology. 

This programme consists of two tiers where Tier 1 is a broad-based programme for all lower secondary students and Tier 2 is a specialised programme for students who demonstrate a passion in STEM. The objective of the ALP is to give our students an opportunity to communicate effectively while collaborating with their peers to engineer innovative solutions that address the healthcare needs of the elderly in Singapore.

Our Tier 1 programme provides the foundation for all our Sec 1 and Sec 2 students to explore integrated learning beyond the curriculum and a platform for them to contribute actively back to our society. This provides an edge for our students to enhance their problem-solving skills and appreciate the current healthcare issues facing Singapore to drive the innovation for the betterment of others in their little ways.

Students will go through a series of lessons which uses the Inquiry approach, leveraging on the 3Es (Engage, Explore and Elaborate). The diagram below shows the timeline of lessons for our Sec 1 and Sec 2 students respectively.

#### Engage <br>

In the first phase of the 5E inquiry model, students are engaged through fostering an interest in authentic contexts in Singapore. The problem-based learning (PBL) approach will expose our students to real world healthcare problems facing the elderly in Singapore today.  They use the problem-based learning approach to conduct case analysis, research and present on the possible solutions for healthcare issues.

*Sec 1- Mental Health of the Elderly <br>
Sec 2- Physical Health of the Elderly*

Through hands-on Science practicals, students analyse the data collected to further understand the issues at hand. The joy of learning is promoted via experiential learning with Science Practical activities.

#### Explore

During the exploration phase, students actively explore the new concept through concrete learning experiences. This phase allows students to learn in a hands-on way. Our students also develop logical and computational thinking through coding workshops that improve their digital literacy. 

-  Secondary 1 students **learn the fundamentals** of micro:bit block based programming to code for reaction games. 

-  Secondary 2 students **apply basic principles** of coding to code and create 3 mini projects with advanced components.

#### Elaborate

The elaboration phase of the 5E Inquiry Model focuses on giving students the space to apply what they’ve learned. This helps them to develop a deeper understanding. Students apply knowledge and skills acquired from the learning experiences in the engage and explain phases to develop viable solutions through a prototype. 

-  Secondary 1 students code and design reaction games to stimulate the mind.

- Secondary 2 students code and design a physical game that encourages the elderly to be more active.

The ALP programme ultimately cultivates a spirit of enterprise in students through innovative solutions and prototypes to address healthcare issues in current landscapes using technology.

### **Tier 2 Programme**

The Tier 2 programme focuses on a selected group of Sec 3 students with interest and aptitude in STEM, so as to enrich and deepen their knowledge in STEM learning through leveraging on external partners.

Sec 3 Students who express greater interest or aptitude in coding are invited to join competitions or interact with professionals from the STEM industry. These students get to work on projects at a higher level and represent the school to compete at national level competitions. 

For example, Sec 3 students who expressed an interest in STEM, attended a webinar titled “Pathways to the Jobs of the Future” where industry experts talked about the trends in digital technologies in March 2021. Selected students also attended a Space Coding Boot Camp organised by Singapore Space and Technology Ltd in June 2021.
