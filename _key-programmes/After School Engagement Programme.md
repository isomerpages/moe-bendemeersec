The After School Engagement (ASE) Programme aims to:

* <p style="text-align:justify">Provide a safe space for students to participate in meaningful self-directed learning and activities after curriculum hours</p>
* <p style="text-align:justify">Enhance studentsâ€™ positive school experience by strengthening teacher- student relationship and peer relationship</p>
* <p style="text-align:justify">Provide opportunities for students to acquire new skills and knowledge</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The school has adopted a proactive approach to engage a target group of students in the ASE programme after school hours. The ASE programme will be managed by at least a staff and an external youth worker engaged by the school.</p>
