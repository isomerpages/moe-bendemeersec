# After School Engagement Programme

The After School Engagement (ASE) Programme aims to:

* Provide a safe space for students to participate in meaningful self-directed learning and activities after curriculum hours
* Enhance studentsâ€™ positive school experience by strengthening teacher- student relationship and peer relationship
* Provide opportunities for students to acquire new skills and knowledge

The school has adopted a proactive approach to engage a target group of students in the ASE programme after school hours. The ASE programme will be managed by at least a staff and an external youth worker engaged by the school.

It operates from **Monday to Thursday from 2.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.**

The activities for the ASE programme can be categorised into 4 broad areas- 1) Appreciation for others, 2) Sports & Games, 3) Visual Arts and 4) Self-exploration.
