# Learning for Life Programme (LLP)

**Introduction**

Bendemeer’s Service Learning for Life Programme (LLP) seeks to provide a variety of rich learning opportunities for students to become co-creators of knowledge. As an education method, service learning provides students with the opportunity to build  character, develop a sense of ethics and modify their value system if need be. Students can also acquire and develop skills that will enable them to becoming an effective leader as well as expand their career awareness. Through civic engagement, community partner collaboration and personal reflection, the LLP will also prepare students for a life of active citizenship.

LLP is embedded in the schools’ Values for Action (VIA) programme which is carried out across the 4/5 years.  At the first tier, the structured program outlined by the school will ensure that all students have the opportunity, autonomy and ownership progressively to chart their progress in being active contributors and citizen leaders.

The second tier involves our student leaders carrying out a student-initiated and self-directed service learning project. All CCAs are also required to lead their own student-initiated service learning projects that preferably leverage on the students’ skills and abilities acquired through the respective CCAs. This we hope will further deepen the schools’ efforts to cultivate an attitude of life-long volunteerism.

Bendemeer adopts a whole school, thematic approach to VIA. The themes for the different levels are as follows:

Students are provided opportunities to choose and plan activities for their beneficiaries. This provides them with greater ownership for their projects since they are able to see that their opinions are powerful while they shape outcomes and make a difference to their surroundings.

The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is embedded into our school’s Values In Action (VIA) Programme. We adopt a thematic approach to VIA, with skills, competencies and student ownership spiralling upwards, along with the integration of different academic subjects. Our LLP takes on the theme of Developing Student Leadership through Service Learning. Service learning as an education method is one means of providing students with the opportunity to develop these traits. Learning occurs through a cycle of action and reflection as students apply their academic skills and knowledge to address real-life needs in their own communities. In the process, students are able to hone leadership skills, discover talents, and gain meaningful personal insight about their own values and aspirations.

Our LLP is carried out at 2 levels. At Tier 1, all students experience a structured 4-year service learning programme as they progress through the levels. Each level is given opportunities to contribute to a different target group within the school/in the community, through the following themes:

Sec 1 – Love our School by showing appreciation for our school workers (including non-teaching and admin/support staff)
Sec 2 – Love our Community by serving the elderly in the community
Sec 3 – Love our World by carrying out issues based learning and serving the children in the community
Sec 4 –Love our environment by raising awareness about global issues

While Tier 1 is a broad-based community service programme involving the whole student population, Tier 2 is undertaken by a selected group of student leaders, namely the Student Council. At Tier 2, service learning takes on a higher level as the student leaders are empowered to plan, organise and execute their projects, with minimal guidance from the teachers. The student leaders work in small groups and initiate 4-5 projects per year, choosing their own desired organisations/community groups to work with.

Some examples of projects undertaken so far include Rainbow Centre, Tsao Foundation, Salvation Army and Club Rainbow.
