##### **Sec 1 LLP: Farm Visits**
As part of the Sec 1 Learning for Life programme (LLP), students will participate in an interactive farm tour that will help them better understand the planting and harvesting process. This will create interest and motivation that can be carried back to classroom activities in their Sec 1 LLP. This visit will also teach students in a direct, hands-on way about many important topics including sustainability and conversation as well as develop in them a better appreciation and understanding of their natural environment.

##### **Sec 1 LLP: Appreciation Day**
As part of the Sec 1 Learning for Life programme, Appreciation Day is a day dedicated to acknowledging the efforts and contributions of our non-teaching staff (cleaners, counsellors, technicians, ICT staff, office staff, Principal and Vice-Principals). The programme will allow
students to show their appreciation to the silent heroes of the school. They will also get to apply their school values, the knowledge learnt from various subject areas e.g. FCE and Science into the programme and develop their leadership and teamwork skills.
