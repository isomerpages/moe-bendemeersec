<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) seeks to equip students with critical
thinking, leadership, and problem-solving skills to address sustainability
challenges through STEM knowledge and the design thinking process. Students
develop environmental literacy, adopt sustainable practices, and engage
in community advocacy, preparing them to lead and inspire broader sustainability
efforts.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The STEM-Sustainable Living program fosters environmental stewardship
and innovation. Students learn to identify and solve sustainability challenges
through design thinking and hands-on experiences. From waste management
and gardening to energy-efficient systems, the program covers a wide range
of topics. By developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and leadership
skills, students are empowered to make a positive impact. ALP Eco Stewards
take the lead on national-level initiatives, promoting sustainability and
global awareness. This program equips students with the knowledge and tools
to create a sustainable future.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The ALP programme introduces all students to sustainability themes across
two years. In Secondary One, the focus is on food, water, and land sustainability
through lessons on sustainable practices, design thinking projects, and
waste reduction campaigns. In Secondary Two, the theme shifts to energy
sustainability, where students analyse carbon footprints, conduct life-cycle
assessments, and engage in debates. They also develop energy-efficient
systems using Microbit technology, such as real-time energy monitoring
and smart lighting controls. The program culminates in campaigns and sustainability
field trips, fostering practical environmental stewardship.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Talent Development Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The ALP Eco Stewards program integrates STEM through scientific inquiry
and engineering skills to investigate environmental issues and design sustainable
systems. It emphasizes leadership in managing national sustainability projects,
advocating for eco-friendly policies, and leading campaigns. The program
also fosters cultural competence by respecting diverse practices and applying
interdisciplinary knowledge to address complex global sustainability challenges.</p>
