<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>Bendemeer Secondary Schoolâ€™s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) aims to
develop all students into Community Youth Leaders who contribute meaningfully
to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge
and skills.&nbsp;The programme provides opportunities for students to broaden
their understanding of the needs of the community through authentic experiences
and deepens their leadership skills and attitudes. Through initiatives
organized, students will acquire and sharpen leadership competencies as
they progresse from Self Leadership to Team Leadership and then to Thought
Leadership.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>In Bendemeer, our Values In Action (VIA) in embedded in our LLP. In Tier
1, we adopt a thematic, spiral approach to our VIA, with skills, competencies,
values, and subject integration spiralling upwards as students move from
Sec 1 to Sec 4/5.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Programme</strong></h4>
<p>Our VIA programme offers a progressive, four-year approach to community
engagement and social responsibility. In Secondary 1, students focus on
"Love Our School," participating in a gardening project that integrates
science learning and culinary skills. Secondary 2 expands to "Love our
Community," with students creating activities for the elderly at local
nursing homes. In Secondary 3, the focus shifts to national and global
issues, exploring themes like "Keeping SG Safe" and "Healthy Living," addressing
topics such as scam awareness, road safety, and balanced diets.</p>
<p>The programme culminates in Secondary 4/5 with "Love Our Environment,"
where students research resource conservation and create awareness campaigns
for Earth Day, collaborating with the Humanities Department. Throughout
the programme, students engage in various community projects, including
working with primary school children, reinforcing the importance of lifelong
learning and school values as they prepare for their next educational journey.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Talent Development Programme</strong></h4>
<p>Tier 2 LLP involves our student leaders who work with CARE Singapore to
engage young children at Morning Star Community Services. Our student leaders
plan activities for the children and engage them during the sessions.</p>
