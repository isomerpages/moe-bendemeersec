Students in different streams could have subject-specific strengths. With Subject Based Banding, students have more flexibility in their learning and can better develop their strengths and interests.  Sec 1 students in the N(A) and N(T) courses could be offered English, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science at a more demanding level.

Students who are eligible will receive a Letter of Offer through Parents Gateway or via email.  More information on Subject-Based Banding will be updated at a later date.
