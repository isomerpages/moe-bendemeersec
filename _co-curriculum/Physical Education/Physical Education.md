### Philosophy of Physical Education

In Bendemeer, the PE department believes that physical and health education is key to providing a holistic development for our students. We, as PE teachers, believe that the most important thing that we can teach our students is to be physically active as it will eventually affect every aspect of their lives. These include mental health, academic achievement, self-esteem, social competencies and the ability to function well in any environment.

As the physical ability and interest of each person change as they age, we provide our students with a broad range of physical competencies so that each individual is enabled at any level of participation to choose and switch to the physical activities and sports most preferred.  They are also able to continue their participation recreationally or competitively, thus motivating them towards lifelong participation.

The introduction of banded classes and PE assessment in recent years also allows us to customise our teaching and learning strategies which enable us to help our students in their learning journey. In addition, the department also provides platforms such as inter-class competitions across different levels within the PE curriculum or through sports events held during the academic year. Such authentic learning experiences provide opportunities for our students to apply the skills that they have acquired and also further strengthen their knowledge of the sports and games. They also get to appreciate the importance of teamwork and team spirit. Their participation in these inter-class competitions also allow them to exemplify our school values of Care, Integrity, Responsibility, Respect and Resilience.

Together with other school programmes, physical and health education contributes to holistic education and the development of 21st Century Competencies. These prepare our students to thrive in a fast-changing and highly-connected world

 
### Philosophy of Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs)

CCAs are an integral part of our students’ holistic education. Our philosophy of CCA is for our students to discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them for the rapidly changing world.

The vision for the CCA department is for every student to develop a sense of accomplishment and enhance his/her self-confidence through active participation in CCA. Guided strongly by the school values of Care, Integrity, Responsibility, Respect and Resilience, the CCA department also places great emphasis in fostering camaraderie, developing individual potential in sports and instilling a life-long passion.

In Bendemeer, each CCA is guided by a CCA Student Development Plan (SDP). This SDP is designed to provide a CCA experience towards progressive development and attainment of CCA learning outcomes as students move from one level to the next. The CCA SDP also provides students with an all year involvement in the CCA.

Provision is also made for all students to be exposed to the basics of the CCA, with the more advanced students supported to excel and develop their talents. A variety of programmes and activities are offered to provide for holistic development and to broaden students’ learning.

Each CCA also incorporates CCA-based Values in Action (VIA) activities or projects which are teacher-led or student-initiated to provide service learning opportunities and student leadership development.

The school also recognises that participation through CCA fosters social integration as students build friendships that are not bound by their diverse backgrounds while they learn, play and grow together. It also deepens the students’ sense of belonging, commitment and responsibility to school, community and nation.
