# Cyber Wellness

Our Cyber Wellness programme is guided by MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework which focuses on the Sense-Think-Act Process.

**MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework**

The aim of our Cyber Wellness programme is to develop responsible digital learners who demonstrate respect for themselves and others through the positive use of technology.

Aligned to our school’s Vision, Mission and Values and Character and Citizenship Education Framework, we seek to plan and implement a holistic Cyber Wellness Education which is customised to our student profile and school environment.

Our Cyber Wellness Education comprises of lessons in the formal curriculum (CCE CW Guidance Module), school-wide programmes (Assembly talks and customised workshops) and the introduction of Cyber Wellness issues to parents through talks and foyer displays during Meet-the-Parent sessions, to reinforce the importance of Cyber Wellness and its messages. Our Cyber Wellness Student Ambassador (CWSA) Programme also provides platforms for our CWSAs to share Cyber Wellness messages with their peers.
