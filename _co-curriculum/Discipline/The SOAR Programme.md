# The SOAR Programme

#### Students Overcome Adversity Responsibly (SOAR)

The SOAR Programme aims to provide healthy and meaningful recreational opportunities for at-risk students. We recognise that some students are more vulnerable to negative influences. This includes latch-key kids, students with minimal parental supervision and those with disciplinary problems.

Our activities are thoughtfully organised to actively engage these students, teach them useful and enjoyable skills and ultimately allow them to enjoy a sense of accomplishment that comes from hard work, in setting and achieving goals. We believe that this self-esteem boost will empower them to make responsible life choices in the long run, and ultimately break out of the at-risk cycle. Our exciting activities include Laser Tag, Futsal, Floorball and Rock Climbing.

One of the memorable activities was when the students in the SOAR (Students Overcome Adversity Responsibly) programme were involved in the pinhole camera project. The students were instructed to make their very own camera from recycled materials. They were skeptical of the functionality of their DIY cameras since they were essentially just cardboard boxes and drink cans. The process was also very tedious as they had to paint the inside of the boxes to ensure that they were light-proof. Their perseverance and spirit of exploration paid off when they tested the cameras by capturing images of the school compound. The boysâ€™ proposal for the pinhole camera project was chosen to be part of the Singapore Youth Festival Celebrations in 2014. They then set up a portable darkroom in Gardens by the Bay. They went on to share their knowledge of pinhole photography with members of the public, and explained to them the process of making and using pinhole cameras. This project gave them confidence in public speaking and we will continue to engage our students in fun and engaging activities in the SOAR programme.

The continued success of this programme is ensured with the team of dedicated teachers in the Discipline committee who are committed to supporting and guiding these students.
