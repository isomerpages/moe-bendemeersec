Every child is unique with individual talents. The various programmes the school has in the normal course hopes to help every child uncover their strengths. The normal course committee aims to build their character and nurture learners in our students.

The committee members consist of teachers from the various departments and the CORE team (Creative and innovative, with the belief that Ordinary students with the Right opportunities will Excel) innovate and customize programmes to meet the needs of the students. We differentiate our programmes to cater to the masses, students with additional needs and the high ability group.
