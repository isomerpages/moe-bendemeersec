<h4><strong>1.  <u>Assessment Intent</u></strong></h4>
<p>School-based Assessments are crucial checkpoints as they enable us to
assess student understanding, tailor teaching methods, and provide real-time
feedback. They offer a holistic evaluation beyond exams, contributing to
a comprehensive view of students' abilities. In Bendemeer Secondary, our
School-Based Assessments comprises of Weighted Assessment (WA) and End-of
Year (EOY) Examinations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Termly Weighted Assessment (WA) are conducted to gauge the learning progress
of the students. These can be in the form of written tests, project work,
performance-based tasks and other forms. Year-End Examination (EOY) will
be conducted at the end of each academic year for Secondary 1, 2 and 3
students.&nbsp; For students who are taking National Examination (<strong>GCE ‘N’ and ‘O’ Level Examination</strong>)
at the end of the year, the school will conduct Non-Weighted Assessments
in Terms 1 and 2 as well as Preliminary Examination at the end of Term
3.</p>
