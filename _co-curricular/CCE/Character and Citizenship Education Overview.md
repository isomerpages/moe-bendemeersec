Our school builds our students’ character and nurtures learners who serve the community. Our programmes develop our students as active learners and responsible citizens based on the school values of Integrity, Care, Respect, Responsibility, Resilience and Harmony, with reference to the CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame.

The CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame takes reference from the existing Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes. It emphasises the interconnectedness of the core values, social and emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills that are critical for character and citizenship development of our students.

CCE 2021 aims to develop in our students:

a) **Good character**: Have a sound moral compass and a strong sense of right and wrong, think critically and ethically, be discerning in judgment, take responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards others and strive for excellence;

b) **Resilience and social-emotional well-being**: Have a balanced sense of self, form healthy relationships, be resilient when faced with challenges, find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude and appreciation;

c) **Future readiness**: Have a sense of purpose in life, develop the dispositions of adaptability and lifelong learning so as to be able to navigate education and career pathways purposefully and take on the challenges of the future, including the world of work and life; and

d) **Active citizenship**: Develop a strong national identity based on a sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in themselves and the future, an awareness of the reality of Singapore’s vulnerabilities and constraints, and the will to act on improving the lives of others, and building a future for our nation.
