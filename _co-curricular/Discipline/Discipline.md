## **Discipline**

The Discipline Committee, headed by Mr. Zuhri as the Discipline Master, has to maintain the overall tone of the school. We believe that every teacher plays a part in maintaining the general discipline of their own students, especially in classroom management.

The school has a discipline policy, which lists down all matters pertaining to discipline, which can be found in the Student Handbook. Students and parents are encouraged to read up on the policy to understand the schoolâ€™s expectations on discipline in our students.

Our school adopts a **three level approach** in dealing with all discipline issues. Every discipline issue starts with the teacher who, in turn, would refer the student to the committee if he or she is unable to engage the child. For Level 3 or more serious offences, the student will be referred to the School Leaders and the school always has constant communication with parents to determine the appropriate actions to be taken.

In our school, **Restorative Practice (RP)** is used as a tool in dealing with disciplinary issues. Teachers are encouraged to use RP in dealing with conflicts with or among students under their charge. In RP, it is crucial to establish and maintain a positive relationship with students.

Our school has a referral system in dealing with disciplinary issues. Referred students are sent to the Detention Centre where they are required to reflect on their misdeeds as a rehabilitative process. During reflection, RP is used. Students are required to pen down their thoughts as to what they have done wrong and how they can restore the situation. A process which we feel is important to ensure our students better internalise the problem, recognise their role in the problem, propose possible ways to resolve the problem and therefore reduce the chance of recommitting the same offence. This would minimise resentment and establish greater trust between teachers and students.

At the same time, the committee also looks into engaging challenging students through programmes like **S.O.A.R (Students Overcome Adversities Responsibly)** that looks into ways to engage students who have strayed.

The Discipline Committee continues to play its part in supporting the school to realise its vision for every Bendemeerian; From Each His Best.
