**Bendemeerian Experience (BEE) Programme** is a signature programme for Secondary 1NT students. Through this programme, students can build their confidence as they learn new skills and discover their interests and talents. Through the engaging activities, student develop values such as care, respect and resilience.

<p style="text-align:justify">In Term 1, students either learn balloon sculpting or circus skills. For balloon sculpting, students develop resilience as they practiced for weeks, in spite of their fears of popping balloons, to put up a beautiful balloon display that framed the stage for our school's Speech Day 2022.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> As they pick up circus skills, students had to persevere to practice the circus acts to perfection and overcome their stage fright to perform live on stage for Speech Day.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In Term 3, students learnt either fencing or skateboarding. For fencing, students were exposed to a new sport that many had not had the opportunity to experience before. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">For skateboarding, students delved deeper into their interests and persevered to attempt skateboarding tricks and styles. </p>
