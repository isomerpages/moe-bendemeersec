Bendemeer Secondary School's Speech Day and Prize-giving Presentation was held on 14th April 2022. We celebrated the achievements of staff and students.

The CCA group also prepared and put up performance on stage for the audience and via Zoom for the students who are in their classrooms. 

We also had an unveiling of our artwork - Precious in our Hands.
