<p style="text-align:justify">The Chinese New Year celebrations this year took place within the individual classrooms. The school population was treated, via Zoom, to an array of stunning performances by the Performing Arts CCA groups, namely, Dance, Choir, Wushu and Band.  Students also obtained a glimpse of how Chinese calligraphy and Chinese painting is done. <br>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Chinese New Year concert was a platform for students to showcase their talent. Concert performances include dancing, singing and martial arts. Exciting quizzes were also organized for students to learn more about the customs and traditions of the Chinese New Year. <br>

<p style="text-align:justify">The highlight of the day was when our very own Bendemeer God of Fortune, accompanied by celebratory sounds, went on his rounds to bless the various classes, much to the delight of Bendemeerians.
It was heartening to see students of Bendemeer Secondary School enjoying the concert and learning more about the Chinese culture. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Various level activities were also planned to cultivate studentsâ€™ appreciation of the Chinese culture. The Secondary One students researched on how different countries celebrated New Year. The Secondary Two students designed Spring Festival Couplets to welcome the new year. The Secondary Three students researched on topics and designed information sheets to introduce the traditions, customs and food items related to Chinese New Year. These works of art produced by the students were displayed at the school foyer to showcase their learning. </p>
