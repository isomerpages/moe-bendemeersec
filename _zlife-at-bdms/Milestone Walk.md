The school organises an annual Milestone Walk for all graduating students. This 8-kilometer walk will take the students from school, through several iconic places in Singapore.

The objectives of the walk are as follow:
 
* instill a sense of mental/psychological resilience among youths, giving them the confidence and mental capacity to tackle challenges;
* increase our students’ appreciation of Singapore’s achievements and the need to maintain harmony; and
* improve class cohesiveness and unity.
