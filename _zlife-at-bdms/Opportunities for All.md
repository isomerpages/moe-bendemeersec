### **Drone Odyssey Challenge**

Our student took part in the Drone Odyssey Challenge, organised by Science Centre Singapore.  

The objective of the event aim to inculcate technical skillsets, critical thinking, and an appreciation of new and disruptive technologies relevant to the modern world.

A series of workshops and live demonstrations have been specially developed for both students and mentors to complement their learning journeys leading up to the competition proper. 

Our students from the Infocomm Club did us proud by emerging champions and first-runners up!  Congratulations!
