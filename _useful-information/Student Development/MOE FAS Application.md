<h4><strong>Onboarding to Household means Eligibility System (HOMES)</strong></h4>
<p>MOE will be onboarding HOMES for means-testing of financial assistance
from the 2026 application cycle. This will streamline the application and
means-testing processes, as most parents will no longer be required to
submit supporting documents, thus making the application process more convenient.</p>
