<h4><strong><u>Criteria for Student Progression</u></strong></h4>
<p>Under Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB), the progression of students,
are guided by a common academic requirement and the criteria for student
progression aligns to the broader efforts by MOE to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>give students greater ownership of their learning according to their readiness,
strengths, interests, and learning needs; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourage students to develop a growth mindset and an intrinsic motivation
to learn for life.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All students generally progress to the next year of learning</strong>,
guided by a common academic requirement that applies at the end of Secondary
2 and Secondary 3.&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Secondary 1 students will progress to Secondary 2. This eases the transition
of a student from primary to secondary school and provides time for students
to adjust to the curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who have done well at the end of Semester 1 and/or 2 of Secondary
1, or at the end of Secondary 2 could consider offering subjects at more
demanding level (MDL).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of Secondary 2 and Secondary 3, students need to meet the following
academic requirement to continue offering subjects at the same subject
levels in the following year: <em>Pass</em><strong><em>*</em></strong><em> (a) EL and 2 subjects, or (b) at least half the total number of examinable subjects</em><strong><em>^</em></strong><em> offered.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who do not meet the academic requirement may offer fewer subjects
and/or offer subjects at a less demanding level (LDL).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* </em><strong><em>Pass</em></strong><em> refers to subject overall mark of at least 50%, regardless of subject level.</em>
<br><em>^ </em><strong><em>Examinable subjects</em></strong><em> do not include CCE, PE and lower secondary Music.</em>
