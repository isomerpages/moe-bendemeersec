community. Your accomplishments, whether big or small, have always been
a source of pride and inspiration for our school. We are currently trying
to build up and strengthen the network of our alumni.</p>
<p>We plan to do so by having a good representation of the alumni from the
different cohorts. With each cohort, you will have your own unique memories

<p>Over the years, our school has grown and evolved. It is important that
we continue to seek opportunities for our current students. We believe
that your unique experiences and insights can greatly contribute to our
current students' growth and the school's future success.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we are thrilled to invite you to join our BDMS Alumni,
where we endeavour to create a vibrant network of former students who share
a common bond and a deep love for our alma mater. Your involvement will
not only reconnect you with old friends and mentors, it will also offer
