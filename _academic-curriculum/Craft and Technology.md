<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>We seek to nurture critical thinking, courageous leadership and civic
responsibility in our students by exposing them to diverse disciplines
such as art, design, business, and music. Through our curriculum, we cultivate
well-rounded individuals who are team players and committed to serving
others.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The Craft &amp; Technology department aims to create an engaging learning
environment that helps students succeed both personally and academically.
We do so by incorporating Authentic Learning, Activity-Based Lessons, and
Problem-Based Learning that help to connect students with real-world challenges,
boosting their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This combination
of approaches ensures students are well-prepared for the demands of a changing
world.</p>
