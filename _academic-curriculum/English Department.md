### **Learning Outcomes**
<p style="text-align:justify">The English and Literature department aims for our students to become effective and empathetic communicators. They should be able to process information critically and provide personal responses with confidence. At the same time, we hope that our students grow to appreciate the nuances of language, and how writers, playwrights and poets use language in a creative manner to bring their thoughts, ideas and opinions alive through the written word.</p>



### **Approach**
Our English Language and Literature teachers enthuse our students in a range of learner-centred experiences, taking into account the need to develop their ability to collaborate with other individuals, as well as reflect on their own learning processes. Through oral presentations, drama and poetry slam performances, story-telling and debates, our students are engaged in various ways to express themselves and become creative and confident speakers. In 2024, our Secondary Four Express and Secondary Five Normal (Academic) students also took up the challenge of producing VLOGS that touched on various contemporary issues such as casual racism, sexism and Artificial Intelligence taking over jobs.

There are sufficient opportunities for our students to take charge of their own learning, as these lessons allow for different types of interaction and discussions to take place, fortifying the use of the language and reinforcing their capabilities to express ideas and opinions. At the same time, we inculcate values in our students as we harness different modes and platforms in getting them to reflect on the wide range of activities they are exposed to, through their four-to-five years of holistic education in Bendemeer Secondary School.

Our teachers are exploring and harnessing the use of AI tools in order to make our students’ learning more self-directed and engaging. At the same time, our teachers adopt the Gradual Release of Responsibility concept in the classroom, ensuring that our students are properly guided through the processes of writing and oral communication. 




### **Key Programmes and Activities**
#### Keeping-It-Current

The Keeping-It-Current (KIC) programme aims to expand the general knowledge of our students, as well as keep them abreast with regard to current affairs and contemporary issues. The programme uses Padlet as a platform for classroom engagement, and our English Language teachers engage their students in meaningful discussions. Students explore online articles and videos, and think about issues critically before forming their personal opinions. The topics covered range from sensitive issues like racism and beauty standards reinforced by social media, to current happenings like our local hawker culture, aging population and environmental issues.



#### Reading Programme

Apart from the texts students encounter during lessons, the English Language and Literature department attempts to supplement the students’ reading materials by subscribing to relevant resources. The different magazines we subscribe to are aligned to the students’ abilities and the syllabi they are offering, broadening their reading experiences and supplementing such experiences with varied activities. Our teachers tap on these resources for vocabulary building, supplementary activities and holiday assignments. 

At the same time, the English Language and Literature department ensures that the school library is kept up-to-date with interesting and exciting reads, with the aim of getting our students to develop a love for reading. Through activities like book reviews, character diagnosis and black-out poems, we hope to encourage more students to pick up a book and delve into the world of reading.

All in all, the Reading Programme aims to promote an appreciation for the language, and exposes our students to information, knowledge and crucial skills they would need to manage their assessment tasks.
