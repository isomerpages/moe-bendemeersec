#### **Our Learning Outcomes**

We seek to develop 21st century competencies in our students through the teaching and learning of the English Language to enable them to be empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers. Our Literature students will learn to be empathetic and global thinkers, critical readers, creative meaning-makers and convincing communicators.



#### **Our Approach**

The English Language and Literature Department weaves the joy of learning with academic rigour. We build multiliteracies, metacognition and inquiry through dialogue through various approaches that harness e-pedagogy and focus on collaborative learning. Our students get to explore different aspects of language and form connections with current contemporary issues that help to broaden their perspectives in an increasingly complex world. 

* Collaborative Learning
* Differentiated Instruction (DI)
* Gradual Release of Responsibility (GRR)
* The CLEARR Pedagogical Framework

#### **Signature Programmes and Activities**
##### **Keeping-It-Current**

Our Keeping-It-Current (KIC) programme aims to expand the general knowledge of our students, as well as keep them abreast with current affairs and contemporary issues. The programme uses Padlet as a platform for classroom engagement, and our students explore online articles and videos, and think about issues critically before forming their personal opinions.

* Secondary 1: Spelling Bee Competition
* Secondary 2: Poetry Slam 
* Secondary 3: Debates

##### **Our Talent Development Programme**
**Upcoming**

Our students get to become content creators who share interesting nuggets about school life and our people, as well as their love for reading by promoting books that can be borrowed from the school library. They also get to share their findings and research on different contemporary issues, as confident, creative and critical thinkers with valuable opinions.
