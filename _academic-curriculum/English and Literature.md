#### **Learning Outcomes**




#### **Approach**

The English Language and Literature Department weaves the joy of learning with academic rigour. Through various approaches that focus on collaborative learning, our students get to explore different aspects of language and form connections with current contemporary issues that help to broaden their perspectives in an increasingly complex world. Our engaging teachers aim to make lessons come alive and get students to express themselves to become creative and confident speakers through oral presentations, drama and poetry slam performances, story-telling and debates.



#### **Our Signature/Signature Programmes and Activities**
##### Keeping-It-Current

Our Keeping-It-Current (KIC) programme aims to expand the general knowledge of our students, as well as keep them abreast with current affairs and contemporary issues. The programme uses Padlet as a platform for classroom engagement, and our students explore online articles and videos, and think about issues critically before forming their personal opinions. The topics covered range from sensitive issues like racism and beauty standards reinforced by social media, to current happenings like our local hawker culture, aging population and environmental issues.



##### Talent Development Initiatives

How does one put into practice what has been learnt? Our talented students get to become content creators who share interesting nuggets about school life and our people, as well as their love for reading by promoting books that can be borrowed from the school library. They also get to share their findings and research on different contemporary issues, as confident, creative and critical thinkers with valuable opinions.
