<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>We seek to develop 21st century competencies in our students through the
teaching and learning of the English Language to enable them to be empathetic
communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers. Our Literature
students will learn to be empathetic and global thinkers, critical readers,
creative meaning-makers and convincing communicators.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The English Language and Literature Department weaves the joy of learning
with academic rigour. We build multiliteracies, metacognition and inquiry
through dialogue through various approaches that harness e-pedagogy and
focus on collaborative learning. Our students get to explore different
aspects of language and form connections with current contemporary issues
that help to broaden their perspectives in an increasingly complex world.</p>

<h4><strong>Signature Programmes and Activities</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Keeping-It-Current</strong></h5>
<p>Our Keeping-It-Current (KIC) programme aims to expand the general knowledge
of our students, as well as keep them abreast with current affairs and
contemporary issues. The programme uses Padlet as a platform for classroom
engagement, and our students explore online articles and videos, and think
about issues critically before forming their personal opinions.</p>
