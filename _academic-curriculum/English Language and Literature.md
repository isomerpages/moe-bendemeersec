<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>We seek to develop 21st century competencies in our students through the
teaching and learning of the English Language and Literature to enable
them to be empathetic and global thinkers, discerning and critical readers,
creative inquirers and convincing communicators.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The English Language and Literature Department combines the joy of learning
with academic rigor by fostering multiliteracies, metacognition, and inquiry
through various e-pedagogical approaches and a focus on collaborative learning.
Students explore different aspects of language and connect with contemporary
issues, broadening their perspectives. Key methods include Collaborative
Learning, Differentiated Instruction (DI), Gradual Release of Responsibility
(GRR), and the CLEARR Pedagogical Framework (Contextualise, Learn &amp;
Explore, Apply &amp; Respond, Reinforce).</p>
