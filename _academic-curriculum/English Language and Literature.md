<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>We seek to develop 21st century competencies in our students through the
teaching and learning of the English Language and Literature to enable
them to be empathetic and global thinkers, discerning and critical readers,
creative inquirers and convincing communicators.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The English Language and Literature Department weaves the joy of learning
with academic rigour. We build multiliteracies, metacognition and inquiry
through dialogue through various approaches that harness e-pedagogy and
focus on collaborative learning. Our students get to explore different
aspects of language and form connections with current contemporary issues
that help to broaden their perspectives in an increasingly complex world.</p>
