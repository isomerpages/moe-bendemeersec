<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>Every physically educated Bendemeerian is empowered to enjoy an active
and healthy lifestyle through regular engagement in physical and outdoor
activities, fostering lifelong habits that contribute to overall well-being
and safety.</p>
<p>In addition to developing physical fitness, students are encouraged to
embody positive character traits such as courage, respect and empathy which
are cultivated through a variety of learning experiences.</p>
<p>Together with other school programmes, physical and health education contributes
to holistic education and the development of 21st Century Competencies.
These prepare our students to thrive in a fast-changing and highly-connected
world.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>Learning Areas</p>
<p>The three learning areas in PE are:</p>
<p>Physical Activity – A variety of sports modules in the categories of territorial-invasion,
net-barrier and striking-fielding are introduced and taught to the students
across the different levels with an emphasis on the learning and demonstration
of sportsmanship by the students. Some examples are these sports modules
are Tchoukball, Badminton, Volleyball, Floorball and Softball. These sports
modules are chosen based on the needs, interests and profile of our students
to encourage them to sustain their participation in some of these activities
beyond secondary school.</p>
<p>Outdoor Education – Outdoor Education engages our students’ spirit of
adventure, develops their resilience and builds their connections with
the environment. The PE department develops the students’ competencies
in outdoor living, sense of place and risk assessment and management. Through
active participation in these experiences, students learn to enjoy outdoor
physical recreation and take actions to live an active, healthy and sustainable
lifestyle.</p>
<p>Physical Health and Safety - Through authentic learning experiences planned
and developed by the PE department, our students develop an understanding
in physical health concepts, healthy and active living, safe practices,
and personal hygiene so that they can make deliberate and informed choices
to remain healthy and active even beyond secondary school.</p>
<p>Teaching approaches</p>
<p>The department uses a variety of teaching approaches to engage the students
experientially and meaningfully. Through such efforts, every student will
feel included in, and involved with, PE lessons.</p>
<p>One of the teaching approaches adopted by the department is a Game-Based
Approach to the teaching of games to help students understand the relevance
of a particular skill in a specific game situation. The PE teacher plays
the role of a facilitator by guiding students’ learning through questioning
and manipulation of task constraints. This approach has the potential to
engage students of different ability levels through modified games and
contextualized skills practice.</p>
<p>The department also leverages on the numerous affective and 21CC learning
opportunities that present themselves in the PE lesson. Tasks in the PE
lesson are designed to create opportunities for students to practice a
desired behaviour. Learning is also facilitated within teachable moments
to draw attention to desired behaviour and highlight possible application
to other situations beyond the lesson.</p>
<p>The PE curriculum aims to instill not only an appreciation for the benefits
of physical and outdoor activity but also the motivation to take initiative
in making healthy choices. Through this holistic approach, every Bendemeerian
learns to integrate an active lifestyle with strong personal values, preparing
them to thrive as responsible and respectful individuals in both school
and beyond.</p>
