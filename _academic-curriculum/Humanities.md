<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>We aim to cultivate critical thinkers who are actively engaged with the
world. Through humanities subjects, students explore the complexities of
past events, current global challenges, and the significance of responsible
citizenship. We foster curiosity, analytical skills, and an understanding
of how human societies shape and are shaped by their environment.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The Humanities Department uses a student-centered, discussion-based approach,
encouraging open dialogue and inquiry. Through collaborative discussions,
students explore diverse perspectives and critically analyze real-world
issues and historical events.</p>
<p>Through performance tasks like our Historical and Geographical Investigations,
students apply inquiry and research skills to explore key themes. We also
provide opportunities for external competitions and real-world experiences,
ensuring practical, well-rounded learning.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Signature Programmes and Activities</strong></h4>
<p>One of our signature programmes is the <em>War &amp; Diplomacy History Card Game</em>,
which we host annually at the national level. This event provides students
from across schools with a platform to engage with historical concepts
in a strategic and interactive manner, enhancing their understanding of
history through gameplay.</p>
<p>Additionally, our in-house Historical and Geogr<em>aphical Investigation Performance Tasks</em> allow
students to dive deeper into specific topics, honing their research skills
and critical thinking abilities.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Talent Development Programme</strong></h4>
<p>To challenge and stretch our students' talents, we promote participation
in external competitions and events like the <em>National History Challenge</em> and <em>International Model United Nations (IMUN)</em>.
We offer opportunities such as debates, seminars, and forums, allowing
students to deepen their passion and understanding of the Humanities.</p>
