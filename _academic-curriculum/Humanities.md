<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>We aim to cultivate critical thinkers who are actively engaged with the
world. Through humanities subjects, students explore the complexities of
past events, current global challenges, and the significance of responsible
citizenship. We foster curiosity, analytical skills, and an understanding
of how human societies shape and are shaped by their environment.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The Humanities Department uses a student-centered, discussion-based approach,
encouraging open dialogue and inquiry. Through collaborative discussions,
students explore diverse perspectives and critically analyze real-world
issues and historical events.</p>
<p>Through performance tasks like our Historical and Geographical Investigations,
students apply inquiry and research skills to explore key themes. We also
provide opportunities for external competitions and real-world experiences,
ensuring practical, well-rounded learning.</p>
