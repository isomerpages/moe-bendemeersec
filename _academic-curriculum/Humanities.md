<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>We aim to cultivate critical thinkers who are actively engaged with the
world. Through humanities subjects, students explore the complexities of
past events, current global challenges, and the significance of responsible
citizenship. We foster curiosity, analytical skills, and an understanding
of how human societies shape and are shaped by their environment.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The Humanities Department focuses on a student-centered, discussion-based
approach that promotes open dialogue and inquiry. Through collaborative
discussions, students explore diverse perspectives and critically analyze
real-world issues and historical events. Students engage in performance
tasks like Historical and Geographical Investigations to apply inquiry
and research skills to key themes. The department also provides opportunities
for external competitions and real-world experiences, ensuring practical,
well-rounded learning.</p>
