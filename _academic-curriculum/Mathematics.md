<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>Our Math Dept envisions all students to achieve mathematical competencies
through a strong mathematics program that enables every child to do Mathematics
that is suited to his/her ability and emphasizes on the five components
(concepts, skills, processes, attitudes, and metacognition) of problem
solving.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>Our approach is through promoting and supporting a comprehensive, innovative,
and dynamic learning environment that nurtures independent learners who
are competent in logical thinking, critical thinking and analytical thinking
skills. We engage the students through the use of varied pedagogy such
as Differentiated Instruction, Thinking Routines, Learning Experiences
as well as Polya’s Problem Solving which enable the students to have deeper
conceptual understanding and to see the relevance of Mathematics in a real-world
context. We also leverage on the following Technology and Tools to enhance
the learning of our students - Google Classroom, GeoGebra and Desmos, Multimedia
Contents, Feedback Assistant and Online Quizzes in SLS.</p>
