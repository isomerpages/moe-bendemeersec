<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>We envision all students to achieve mathematical competencies through
a strong mathematics programme that enables every child to do Mathematics
that is suited to his/her ability and emphasizes on the five components
(concepts, skills, processes, attitudes, and metacognition) of problem
solving.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The Mathematics Department’s approach is through promoting and supporting
a comprehensive, innovative, and dynamic learning environment that nurtures
independent learners who are competent in logical thinking, critical thinking
and analytical thinking skills. We engage the students through the use
of varied pedagogy such as Differentiated Instruction, Thinking Routines,
Learning Experiences as well as Polya’s Problem Solving which enable the
students to have deeper conceptual understanding and to see the relevance
of Mathematics in a real-world context. We also leverage on the following
Technology and Tools to enhance the learning of our students - Google Classroom,
GeoGebra and Desmos, Multimedia Contents, Feedback Assistant and Online
Quizzes in SLS.</p>
