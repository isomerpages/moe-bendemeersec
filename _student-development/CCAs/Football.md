<h4><strong>Our Football CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Character building and leadership development are key priorities in our
Football CCA where the importance of values, teamwork and leadership are
emphasised. All our passionate young footballers seek to strive for sporting
excellence by adopting a mindset of resilience and learning to put team
success before personal accolades.</p>
<p>Our outcomes are possible through a robust support structure from the
school to allow all footballers to develop and &nbsp;strengthen not only
their football skills but their character and leadership abilities as well.</p>
