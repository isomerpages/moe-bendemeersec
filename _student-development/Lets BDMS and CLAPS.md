<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>In today’s rapidly evolving world, it is essential to empower students
with the skills and competencies rooted in a strong values system, enabling
them to thrive in complex, diverse environments. Recognizing the interconnected
nature of each student’s educational journey, we aim to foster a holistic
learning experience that supports their personal growth and aspirations,
equips them to meet 21st Century Competency (21CC) outcomes, and develops
their capacity to lead themselves and others.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>We recognize that education goes beyond the classroom and syllabuses,
encompassing a wide range of experiences and skills that contribute to
the holistic development of students.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Let’s BDMS! and CLAPS!</strong> are strategic start of term and
end of semester programmes conceptualised to enhance the lived learning
experiences of our students particularly post-COVID, and to cultivate them
as critical learners, confident leaders and compassionate contributors
anchored in character, collaboration and community.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Signature Programmes and Activities</strong></h4>
<p><strong>“Let’s BDMS!”</strong> starts the four academic terms right by
nurturing them to <strong>B</strong>e anchored in values, <strong>D</strong>are
to aspire, <strong>M</strong>otivate one another and <strong>S</strong>trengthen
their strengths. “<strong>Let’s BDMS</strong>!” start the term programme
to welcome students back to school and instil core values and competencies
while fostering positive habits and connections with peers and teachers.
All students are immersed into programmes that strengthen the guiding principle
for the term, competencies targeted at the respective levels to start them
right for the term with positivity and possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<strong>CLAPS!</strong>” serves as an end-of-semester programme for students
to build on their awareness and skills in domains of <strong>C</strong>ognitive, <strong>L</strong>eadership, <strong>A</strong>esthetics
and Cultural, <strong>P</strong>hysical and <strong>S</strong>ocio-emotional
and mental well-being competencies. It aims to end the semester with positive
emotions, build new skills, and nurture habits, while celebrating staff
and students’ efforts for the semester. It is also intended that with the
new experiences and skills built being exposed to new activities, students
start the holidays with positive emotions, new skillsets and enduring habits
for the long break and would be engaged purposefully.</p>
