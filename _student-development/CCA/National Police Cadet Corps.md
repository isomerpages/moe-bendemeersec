<h4><strong>Our National Police Cadet Corps CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC)</strong> is a uniformed group
co-curricular activity (CCA) that is closely affiliated with the Singapore
Police Force (SPF). It aims to develop students into responsible citizens
with strong values, leadership, and a sense of civic responsibility.</p>
<p>Our program instills core values such as discipline, integrity, and responsibility
in cadets, while offering insights into Singapore's justice system and
law enforcement through collaboration with the Singapore Police Force (SPF).</p>
<h4><strong>Our Signature Programmes and Activities</strong></h4>
<p>Cadets are given opportunities to develop leadership skills by organizing
and leading activities like camps, drills, and community projects. Physical
fitness and mental toughness are strengthened through drills, physical
training, and outdoor activities, while engagement in crime prevention
outreach and community service projects fosters a strong sense of social
responsibility.</p>
