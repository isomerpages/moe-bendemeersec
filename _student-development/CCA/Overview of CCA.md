<h4><strong>CCA Overview</strong></h4>
<p>As a Key Student Development Experience (SDE), CCAs allow our students
to discover their interests and talents while developing character, social
emotional&nbsp;competencies as well other relevant skills that will prepare
them for the rapidly changing world.</p>
<p>Each CCA has its specific objectives. Physical Sports CCAs develop robustness,
fair play and team spirit in students. Performing Arts CCAs instill in
students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture
and heritage of a multi-racial society. Uniformed Groups activities aim
to make good citizens of students by inculcating in them self-reliance,
resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to others. Clubs and Societies
(CS) allow students to explore and extend their interests in wide ranging
and specialised areas which may be knowledge-based or skills-based. Students
are honed in information, communication and technical skills as they strive
to grow their mastery of the specialised areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Bendemeer, Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is also infused into
our CCAs. The schoolâ€™s ECG counsellor interacts with the students and expose
them to knowledge about industries related to their strengths and interest
in the respective CCA areas. They are then able to make informed choices
about future education and career pathways post-secondary education. One
example is the students from Physical Sports CCAs being exposed to the
different careers in the Sports Industry through learning journeys and
workshops tailored for them. They also get to experience how Sports Science
can help them in their performance in their respective sports.</p>
