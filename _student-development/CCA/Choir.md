<h4><strong>Our Choir CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Our goal is to nurture choir members into confident individuals who embrace
life with adaptability and resilience. We aim to help them build on their
strengths, develop discernment in judgment, and communicate effectively
as leaders of tomorrow. Through their journey, they will grow as self-directed
learners and team players who take responsibility for their own growth,
driven by a passion for music and singing, while cultivating curiosity
and perseverance in their lifelong learning.</p>
<p>Additionally, we seek to instill a strong sense of civic responsibility
in our members, encouraging them to be engaged citizens. They will develop
a sense of responsibility to their family, community, and nation, actively
participating in public performances. Alongside this, we emphasize the
importance of values and social-emotional competencies, fostering skills
in self-awareness, social awareness, self-management, and responsible decision-making.</p>
