<h4><strong>Our Cross Country CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The Bendemeer Secondary School Cross-Country team is a CCA for passionate
runners. Through rigorous training, members develop endurance, refine techniques,
and build mental resilience.</p>
<p>Beyond cross-country races, our team actively participates in various
track events, ensuring that every member has the opportunity to represent
the school in at least one competition. These experiences not only challenge
students to push their limits but also broaden their perspectives as they
engage and compete with peers from other schools.</p>
