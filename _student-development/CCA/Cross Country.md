<h4><strong>Our Cross Country CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The Bendemeer Secondary School Cross-Country team is a CCA for passionate
runners. Through rigorous training, members develop endurance, refine techniques,
and build mental resilience. Beyond cross-country races, our team actively
participates in various track events, ensuring that every member has the
opportunity to represent the school in at least one competition. These
experiences not only challenge students to push their limits but also broaden
their perspectives as they engage and compete with peers from other schools.</p>
