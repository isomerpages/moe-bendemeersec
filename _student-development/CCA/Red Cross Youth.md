<h4><strong>Our Red Cross Youth CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Red Cross Youth (RCY) plays an important role in our humanitarian movement,
inducting cadets into the world of humanitarianism; training and empowering
them to serve their communities effectively. By participating in RCY, cadets
are groomed to become good citizens with strong senses of civic responsibility.
They are trained to be adaptable, resilient and confident team players.</p>
<p>Our RCY curriculum also incorporates&nbsp; leverage on digital technology
to nurture future-ready youth. For example, we conduct workshops to train
students on drone operation and engage them in simulation exercises. These
collective efforts will pave the way for our youth to be trained in Overseas
Disaster Deployment Training in future, which will open avenues for volunteering
opportunities such as overseas disaster response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We take pride in making a meaningful difference in the lives of others
and lend a Hand for Humanity!</p>
<h4><strong>Our Signature Programmes and Activities</strong></h4>
<p>Our key programmes include First Aid training and besides training the
cadets in Standard First Aid, our revised curriculum will emphasise mental
wellness and self-care by incorporating psychological first aid. When our
cadets are trained in psychological first aid, they can help mitigate the
stress symptoms and assist in a healthy recovery following a traumatic
event, natural disaster or public health emergency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the highlights each year will be the Red Cross Youth Camp, an overnight
adventure camp where they get to try different outdoor activities. Cadets
also train to become Youth Ambassadors for the blood donation drives in
Singapore, and relish the opportunity to go on learning journeys to the
Health Science Authority Blood Bank each year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is Service Learning where cadets actively raise funds for the local
community and volunteer at activity centres for the disabled in Singapore.
Our cadets are also exposed to different experiential learning programmes
like virtual reality and drone flying at the Science Centre.</p>
<p>Our unit leaders enjoy the Unit Leaderâ€™s Camp each year, and they graduate
to be skilled in leading the unit.&nbsp;</p>
