<h4><strong>Our Red Cross Youth CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Red Cross Youth (RCY) is a vital part of the humanitarian movement, introducing
cadets to humanitarian values and equipping them with skills to serve their
communities. RCY grooms cadets to be responsible, adaptable, resilient,
and confident team players. The curriculum incorporates digital technology,
such as drone operation workshops and simulation exercises, to nurture
future-ready youth. These efforts aim to prepare youth for future Overseas
Disaster Deployment Training, opening opportunities for international disaster
response volunteering.&nbsp;</p>
