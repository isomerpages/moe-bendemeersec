<h4><strong>Our Red Cross Youth CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Red Cross Youth (RCY) plays an important role in our humanitarian movement,
inducting cadets into the world of humanitarianism; training and empowering
them to serve their communities effectively. By participating in RCY, cadets
are groomed to become good citizens with strong senses of civic responsibility.
They are trained to be adaptable, resilient and confident team players.</p>
<p>Our RCY curriculum also incorporates&nbsp; leverage on digital technology
to nurture future-ready youth. For example, we conduct workshops to train
students on drone operation and engage them in simulation exercises. These
collective efforts will pave the way for our youth to be trained in Overseas
Disaster Deployment Training in future, which will open avenues for volunteering
opportunities such as overseas disaster response.&nbsp;</p>
