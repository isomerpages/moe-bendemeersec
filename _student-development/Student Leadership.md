<h4><strong>Student Leadership</strong></h4>
<p>In Bendemeer, we believe that every student can be developed as a leader.
As such, every student should be developed as a leader. Hence, to ensure
that all Bendemeerians have a baseline understanding of leadership and
are equipped with leadership competencies and dispositions, we are intentional
in providing differentiated development for our students.</p>
<p>The Student Leadership Framework adopts a progressive leadership dimension
approach. Students sharpen their skill set as they progress from self-leadership
to team leadership, and then to thought leadership. Self-leadership sets
the foundation for developing leadership potential by focusing on self-mastery
and personal effectiveness. Team leadership focuses on managing team dynamics
as students lead their peers, while <em>thought leadership</em> focuses on
being effective influencers to create value in their area of influence.</p>
<h4><strong>Student Leadership Framework</strong></h4>
<p>The Student Leaders comprises Class Chairpersons, Peer Support Leaders,
Student Councillors and CCA Leaders. In their respective roles, they applied
their leadership skills in the various platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>The Leaders Council (LEADS)</strong></h4>
<p>The Leaders Council (LEADS) consists of the top-tier student leaders from
the four leadership groups. In line with our student leaders' motto to
Lead and Serve, LEADS will Lead, Elevate, Adapt, Direct, and Serve the
school and community. LEADS aims to elevate each other to new heights as
members discuss and coordinate activities, share ideas, and work together
to enhance the student experience. They will apply their adaptive thinking,
communication, and collaboration skills to provide input for the overall
running of the school with regard to school improvement. They represent
the voice of the student body through Student Forum sessions. LEADS serves
as the directional leadership of the student leadership group. Members
come together to think strategically and set direction. Together, LEADS
will serve the school and the community through various inter-school platforms.</p>
