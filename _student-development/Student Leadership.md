<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcome</strong></h4>
<p>The Student Leadership Framework adopts a progressive leadership dimension
approach. Students sharpen their skill set as they progress from self-leadership
to team leadership, and then to thought leadership. Self-leadership sets
the foundation for developing leadership potential by focusing on self-mastery
and personal effectiveness. <strong><em>Team leadership</em></strong> focuses
on managing team dynamics as students lead their peers, while <strong><em>thought leadership</em></strong> focuses
on being effective influencers to create value in their area of influence.</p>

<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Believe, Develop, Mentor, Serve</strong> Leadership practices</p>
<p>In line with our mission of “Lead and Serve” the SLD Framework is anchored
on the 4 practices of Believe, Develop, Mentor, Serve to develop and support
our Bendemeerian Leader. It is undergirded by The Leadership Challenge
(Kouzes &amp; Posner) and The Servant Leadership (Robert Greenleaf) as
the basis of our leadership practices.</p>
<p><strong>Believe</strong>
</p>
<p>A student leader’s journey begins by addressing their beliefs. They believe
that they can grow in their leadership qualities regardless of starting
point. They have an influence and can serve to make a difference within
their sphere of influence. Additionally, a growth mind-set is fundamental
in providing the motivation for student leaders to continue learning and
improving so as to serve and enact positive change in our community.</p>
<p><strong>Develop</strong>
</p>
<p>Student leaders will seek to first deepen their understanding of self
and develop their self-mastery leadership skills. They will be taught skills,
knowledge and values to first lead themselves before leading others. To
better harness their potential, students will gain awareness of their strengths
and work on areas that need improvement. They will be supported with progressive
training and various leadership opportunities, e.g. Class Committees, Class
Chairpersons, CCA leaders, to practise their leadership skills as they
grow in the self, team and thought leadership dimensions.</p>
<p><strong>Mentor</strong>
</p>
<p>The value of care and establishing strong relationships are key to student
leadership development. Student leaders will be mentored by their significant
adults, e.g. Form Teachers, Alumni, CCA Coaches/Instructors. They will
mentor them through guided reflections so that they can maximize their
learning experiences. Conversely, student leaders will be urged to invest
in quality relationships - build their teams and mentor their juniors and
allow others to build them up as well.</p>
<p><strong>Serve</strong>
</p>
<p>Student leaders will delve deep and evaluate their commitments. They prioritise
the growth and well-being of others over self and serve their peers and
school to create a positive culture and a conducive environment for learning
and relationship building.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Signature Programmes and Activities</strong></h4>
<p>The Student Leaders comprises Class Chairpersons, Peer Support Leaders,
Student Councillors and CCA Leaders. In their respective roles, they applied
their leadership skills in the various platforms.</p>
<h4><strong>The Leaders Council (LEADS)</strong></h4>
<p>The Leaders Council (LEADS) consists of the top tier student leaders of
the four leadership groups. LEADS are empowered to&nbsp; <strong>L</strong>ead, <strong>E</strong>levate, <strong>A</strong>dapt, <strong>D</strong>irect
and <strong>S</strong>erve the school and community through various platforms
e.g. Student Forum, Youth Day Celebration. LEADS serves as the directional
leadership of the student leadership group and represent the voice of the
student body through Student Forum sessions. LEADS members come together
to think strategically and set direction and work together to enhance the
student experience.
