<h4><strong>CCA Overview</strong></h4>
<p>As a key Student Development Experience (SDE), CCAs allow our students
to discover their interests and talents while developing character, social
emotional competencies as well other relevant skills that will prepare
them for the rapidly changing world.</p>
<p>In Bendemeer Secondary School, all CCAs are planned with the following
guiding principles in mind.</p>
<h4><strong>Be Anchored in Values</strong></h4>
<p>Through active participation, our students strengthen the cultivation
of school values and enact them through an authentic learning environment
in the CCAs.</p>
<h4><strong>Dare to Aspire</strong></h4>
<p>Our students are not bound by their diverse backgrounds as they strive
collectively for excellence in their respective CCA domains, showing responsibility
and accountability in their actions and commitments to the best of their
abilities.</p>
<h4><strong>Motivate One Another</strong></h4>
<p>Our CCAs are planned with opportunities for students to develop leadership
competencies. Our students first learn to exercise personal leadership
before taking on significant leadership roles in their respective CCAs,
inspiring and motivating their peers towards team excellence.</p>
<h4><strong>Strengthen Our Strengths</strong></h4>
<p>Through CCAs, our students can discover what they are passionate about.
With a robust support structure in place, they can build on their existing
strengths to allow them to become better versions of themselves, setting
themselves up for success.</p>
