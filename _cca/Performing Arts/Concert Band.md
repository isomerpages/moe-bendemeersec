<p style="text-align:justify">2021 has indeed been a unique year for the Concert Band, amidst the global pandemic. We started the year with the Secondary One orientation, through a class-by-class presentation rather than the typical trying out of instruments. We were pleasantly surprised by the number of enthusiastic Secondary Ones joining Band this year.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">However, our usual Band practices were disrupted by the Covid-19 restrictions and hence the focus in the first half of the year laid heavily on our senior Band members, who were focused on the biennial 2021 Singapore Youth Festival Presentation. Training intensified as the competition drew nearer in April. Despite the uncertainties of the new measures and restrictions in place for the performance, our students pulled through with their heartfelt rendition of Acclamations by Ed Huckeby, eventually clinching an Accomplishment award. The school is very proud of their efforts and achievements.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">After the SYF season, we sincerely bade farewell to our graduating Band members who have to focus on their national examinations. Following the loosening of restrictions for CCA to resume, our lower secondary students started band practice again in the middle of Term 2. The Secondary Ones, in particular, were ecstatic to finally learn to play their allocated instruments. Under the guidance of our instructors and more experienced players, we are positive that Concert Band can flourish through the adversities and continue to excel in the coming years.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">The most memorable event that I have participated in is the Singapore Youth Festival in 2021. Even though we did not achieve the Certificate of Distinction, we really tried our best and for this year’s SYF, we did not really get any help from our seniors due to the pandemic and strict rules about intermingling But we were lucky enough to have our tutors, instructor and teachers supporting us. I would like to say to the current and future Band members that they should always support one another, always work together as one and have respect for each other.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">The most memorable time in Band was the 2019 SYF. It was an honour to represent my school at the competition and I truly enjoyed the experience shared with my juniors, friends and seniors. All our hard work paid off – the best part was when we achieved the SYF Distinction Award. Being appointed as Band Major helped me to develop my leadership and communication skills through managing the band. I have become more responsible and mature over the last 4 years with Band. I am very thankful to be able to work with all my amazing bandmates, who made band practices fun and enjoyable.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">So far during my time in band, I have had a very enriching experience. I got to meet many people with common interests and saw each other grow as individuals. I think that Band is not only about playing the instrument, but also developing core values. Through the many practice sessions, I have learnt the true meaning of companionship as I spent time with my fellow CCA mates practising. I also realised that one need not only have talent for something, but more importantly the passion and eagerness to learn. One memorable moment was right before we went onstage for the SYF competition, I saw members reassuring each other that they were going to do well, despite being equally nervous themselves. I think that shows a lot about how being in Band allows students to develop compassion, along with close relationships, that continue to blossom outside of the CCA.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">My most memorable experience in band is when I attended the 2021 Singapore Youth Festival. I got to experience it with my seniors and friends. It was my first SYF in Secondary School and with the help from my bandmates and teachers, I was able to catch up and do my best. I learnt new skills and new things about music. I would like to thank my seniors for guiding me and helping me to improve. I would also like to thank my teachers and instructors for their support.</p>
