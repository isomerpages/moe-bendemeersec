#### About the Concert Band

<p style="text-align:justify">The Bendemeer School Band meets twice a week, Mondays &amp; Thursdays, from 3 pm to 6 pm to train its band members. Besides learning the proper playing of the musical instruments, the band members are given exposure and opportunity to lead their fellow bandmates too. Roles such as drum majors, band majors, quarter masters and librarians, essential roles in a school band, develops responsibility, resilience and most importantly harmony in our members. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Bendemeer School Band has also performed in school concerts and public performances such as the Limelight Series Concert organised by Esplanade. Performing for a live audience also teaches the band members to be confident, self-reliant, and quick-thinking. Above all, playing for the school band has motivated them to cherish moments when they get to work as a team - playing together, growing together.</p>


#### Reflection

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">My band life has been a very memorable one and it would definitely be something that Iâ€™ll treasure a lot. To me, Band was one of the few things that I always looked forward to when I go to school, music really helps to calm me down and I really enjoy what I am doing in band. My experience in Band has been very fun, I enjoyed the times when my friends and I would come together to play music together. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">Being in Band has taught me the value of teamwork and harmony very strongly. This is because when one of my counterparts is not doing well, the band would sound drastically different. Even though only one person was off-tune, it could really affect how we sound, and if we are not getting along together, we would not get anything done. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">Getting the results of our SYF was important to us, however, what I found more important is the journey and experience that we all went through as one united Band. The journey for the competition was truly a most memorable one.</p>
