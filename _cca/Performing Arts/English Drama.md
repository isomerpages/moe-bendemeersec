<p style="text-align:justify">We started the year with the usual introductory orientation sessions for the Secondary Ones. A robust number of Secondary Ones signed up for the CCA. The highlight for this year was the Singapore Youth Festival Art Presentation. Due to the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, we kept the number of participants small. Our entry – Vertical Lines – focuses on the dilemma youths face. Can they empower themselves to overcome their own unique situations?</p>


<p style="text-align:justify">We were very pleased to be awarded a Certificate of Commendation for our effort. Those who did not take part in SYF were involved in their own mini-production. This gave them the opportunity to show off their skills as well. Our bumper crop of Secondary Ones joined us in Term 2. Guided by Ms Ivy, they were initiated into the world of Poetry Slam.  We look forward to another year of exciting activities in 2021 as we spark their creativity in upcoming stage productions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">‘As the President of Drama Club, this year definitely helped me develop my leadership skills. I took up the role of stage manager for SYF. It allowed me to step out of my usual social circle and bond with my juniors more. I enjoyed the new challenge.’</p>
