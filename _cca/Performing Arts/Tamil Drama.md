I take great pride in both myself and my fellow CCA members for our dedicated efforts that have brought us to where we are today. Throughout our journey, we remained a cohesive team, supporting and encouraging one another during both favorable and challenging times. Taking on the role of a leader has enhanced my self-confidence in expressing my thoughts and taught me how to effectively engage with people from various backgrounds. My patience has greatly improved, proving to be a valuable skill. The SYF practice, which demanded immense dedication, also taught me the importance of responsible leadership and the value of teamwork.</em></p><p><strong>- Balamurugan Vicknesh (4R2) <br>CCA Chairperson 2022–2023</strong></p><p><em>In my four years in Drama Tamil, I have learned more about Indian traditions, such as Kolam drawing and Therukoothu.
