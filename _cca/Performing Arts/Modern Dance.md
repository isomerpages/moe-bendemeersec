<p style="text-align:justify">The year 2023 has presented us with significant tests of patience, resilience, and adaptability. A significant portion of our club members joined during the Covid period, which not only required us to refine our skills and boost our confidence but also to learn how to effectively collaborate as a cohesive club.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">We commenced the year by actively promoting our club at Bendemeer's CCA fair. This event had not been held for several years, making it a unique experience for both the juniors and the seniors. Subsequently, we conducted auditions to recruit new dance members into our team. We then dedicated ourselves to rigorous training sessions in preparation for the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF), all while simultaneously preparing for our Chinese New Year Celebration.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">During the wait for the new members, our SYF performers diligently persevered, investing their time and effort into thorough preparation. With three practice sessions per week and additional self-practice sessions, we not only witnessed different facets of each other's talents but also fostered a stronger bond within the team. This journey resulted in us getting the highest level of achievement, the Certificate of Distinction.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Most recently, we showcased our talents during Bendemeer's 46th Speech Day. Additionally, we have begun integrating our training sessions to foster unity within the club, irrespective of our individual levels. This year has been marked by unwavering support from the school leaders, teachers, and instructors, for which we are immensely grateful. We eagerly anticipate the opportunity to present more remarkable performances in the future.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I find Dance CCA fun but it takes a lot of patience and motivation. I also enjoy going to CCA as I get to meet other dancers and learn different tricks and tips from them.</p>

**-Syarizah (1C4)**


<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I feel that dance is a good way to learn resilience as we have Physical Training and we have to push through it. Even when we do not get the dance moves at first, we have to keep practicing with the help of seniors and the instructor. </p>
	
**- Kwok Wen Qi, Vanessa (1C8)**

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">CCA so far has been going well for me and I no longer feel tense during CCA. Instead, I feel happy to come for training. I would like to improve my performance in the CCA by pushing myself to the next level and work hard to become the best dancer I can be. </p>

**- Reeya (2R2)**
 
<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">My experience in the CCA has been very interesting . CCA is my place of comfort and yes it can be tiring most of the time. However, it is all worth it in the end. Having the opportunity to perform in the SYF has to be the best experience in my CCA journey. I learnt many valuable lessons and I am very sure that there will be more to come.</p>

**- Nur Sarah Ellyana (2R3)**

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I have learnt to never give up and to push myself when I am tired. I also realised that as a team, we can achieve whatever we aim for. We just have to have faith and trust one another.</p>

**- Vishnavi (2R4)**

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I feel that being in the Dance CCA has allowed me to experience growth. I also feel that as a team, we are taking it up a notch higher and growing together. CCA has taught me important life lessons such as being resilient in the mind and in the heart. I have started to develop a mindset that is ready for any possibilities - failure or success. I am proud of where my team and I are at right now as we continue to push through and achieve greater heights. </p>

**- Naw Eh Gay Su Lwin (3R5)**

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I joined the CCA because I have a keen interest in Dance. I also feel that dancing is one way for me to relieve my stress especially at times when I feel overwhelmed. Overall, being in the Dance CCA has taught me to be more confident in expressing my emotions. My fellow Dance Club members have been very friendly, helpful and welcoming. I feel very comfortable being in the club and I truly enjoy being a member of the Dance CCA. </p>

**- Nur Diniy Insyirah (3R8)**

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">Personally, I never considered myself an art student, as my interests lay outside the realm of performing arts. However, being a part of this CCA has not only provided me with new knowledge and skills but also a sense of belonging. Dance has become an integral part of my identity, and I am eternally grateful for the opportunities this CCA has afforded me. </p>
