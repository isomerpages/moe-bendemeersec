<p style="text-align:justify">We faced 2021 with anticipation and enthusiasm even though we knew that Covid-19 was still prevalent in our society. News that training would resume delighted one and all. The dancer inside of us was itching to break free. No wonder they say that dance is a form of expression.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">We started the year off with the Secondary One Orientation where the students would have a chance to show off some moves during the audition process. Our instructor, Mr Khye, single-handedly carried out the auditions to spot potential talents. This was no easy task but he managed to clinch us some hidden gems.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">After the auditions, the dance club moved full steam ahead. We had no time to rest as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation was up ahead. This would be no easy feat with all the Safety Management Measures (SMM) that we had to ensure were in place. This was the time that our perseverance was really tested, we had to juggle between our numerous practices, school work and our family duties. There were times when we broke down but we pulled ourselves back up as a club by reflecting on our motto ‘Dance to express, not to impress’. This was our opportunity to express ourselves freely and to make our school proud. We succeeded as we were awarded a Certificate of Accomplishment in the SYF Central Judging for Dance (International).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">After SYF was over, we welcomed in the Secondary One students where Mr Khye taught them the proper techniques of doing warm ups so that they would not get hurt and also a choreography to test their memory. Sad to say, these physical sessions were cut short due to the implementation of Home-Based Learning (HBL). However, to keep their passion in dance burning, we carried on with CCA Zoom sessions. The students found it interesting and even asked when the next one would be held.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">These past few months have really been challenging however we are looking forward to burn up the dance floor once the situation improves.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">These four years have been like a roller coaster to me. During this time, I have learnt to become a much stronger and a more confident person. I will never forget this amazing journey with such fabulous people. These past few years have been tough due to the ongoing pandemic, coping with both CCA and schoolwork. However, I am proud that as a team we have managed to pull through and emerged stronger dancers. I am proud of being a part of TSA and I want to thank everyone who has given me a helping hand along the way.</p>

**- Tan Zhi Ning (President)**


<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">My time in the dance club has been fantastic as I have made many friends and have finally fulfilled the dream of learning how to dance. I remember vividly when I was in Secondary One, I was so inspired by the dancers from the club that I made dance my number 1 choice. What moves me is that the dancers are all so nice and caring to one another. The stronger dancers even help the weaker ones without complaints. This is the main reason why I have improved tremendously over the years and I am very thankful to those who have helped me in my growth.</p>

**- Gurpal Singh Saini (Vice-President)**

 
<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">My journey in dance has been a memorable and enjoyable experience. I was able to overcome challenges and gain confidence with the help of the people around me in the dance club. I have not only gained much skills and techniques in dance but am also able to build long-lasting friendships with my members. Through this journey that I have had with the dance club, I have realised the importance of teamwork, determination and perseverance. All these coupled with the positive environment from the club has made me achieve success.</p>
