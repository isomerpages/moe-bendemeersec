<p style="text-align:justify">The year 2023 has presented us with significant tests of patience, resilience, and adaptability. A significant portion of our club members joined during the Covid period, which not only required us to refine our skills and boost our confidence but also to learn how to effectively collaborate as a cohesive club.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">We commenced the year by actively promoting our club at Bendemeer's CCA fair. This event had not been held for several years, making it a unique experience for both the juniors and the seniors. Subsequently, we conducted auditions to recruit new dance members into our team. We then dedicated ourselves to rigorous training sessions in preparation for the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF), all while simultaneously preparing for our Chinese New Year Celebration.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">During the wait for the new members, our SYF performers diligently persevered, investing their time and effort into thorough preparation. With three practice sessions per week and additional self-practice sessions, we not only witnessed different facets of each other's talents but also fostered a stronger bond within the team. This journey resulted in us getting the highest level of achievement, the Certificate of Distinction.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Personally, I never considered myself an art student, as my interests lay outside the realm of performing arts. However, being a part of this CCA has not only provided me with new knowledge and skills but also a sense of belonging. Dance has become an integral part of my identity, and I am eternally grateful for the opportunities this CCA has afforded me.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Most recently, we showcased our talents during Bendemeer's 46th Speech Day. Additionally, we have begun integrating our training sessions to foster unity within the club, irrespective of our individual levels. This year has been marked by unwavering support from the school leaders, teachers, and instructors, for which we are immensely grateful. We eagerly anticipate the opportunity to present more remarkable performances in the future.</p>

Our lively Dance members!


<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">These four years have been like a roller coaster to me. During this time, I have learnt to become a much stronger and a more confident person. I will never forget this amazing journey with such fabulous people. These past few years have been tough due to the ongoing pandemic, coping with both CCA and schoolwork. However, I am proud that as a team we have managed to pull through and emerged stronger dancers. I am proud of being a part of TSA and I want to thank everyone who has given me a helping hand along the way.</p>

**- Tan Zhi Ning (President)**


<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">My time in the dance club has been fantastic as I have made many friends and have finally fulfilled the dream of learning how to dance. I remember vividly when I was in Secondary One, I was so inspired by the dancers from the club that I made dance my number 1 choice. What moves me is that the dancers are all so nice and caring to one another. The stronger dancers even help the weaker ones without complaints. This is the main reason why I have improved tremendously over the years and I am very thankful to those who have helped me in my growth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">My journey in dance has been a memorable and enjoyable experience. I was able to overcome challenges and gain confidence with the help of the people around me in the dance club. I have not only gained much skills and techniques in dance but am also able to build long-lasting friendships with my members. Through this journey that I have had with the dance club, I have realised the importance of teamwork, determination and perseverance. All these coupled with the positive environment from the club has made me achieve success.</p>
