<p style="text-align:justify">Bendemeer School Choir meets twice a week (Mondays & Wednesdays, 4 pm to 6 pm) to train our choir members. Besides learning the proper vocal production techniques, we train studentsâ€™ leadership by assigning them to lead the warm-ups, choreograph the dance movements for performances and plan choir camp activities.  </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I have always loved to sing but I did not have the confidence to do so in front of others. The choir had helped me to hone not only my singing ability but also my confidence and leadership abilities. At first, the training was tiring and difficult, however I always looked forward to attending CCA as I get to do what I love to do and train together with my friends. In choir, I made numerous unforgettable memories and experiences that I would always be grateful for. I am truly glad that I decided to join the choir. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I learnt a lot of new things, made a lot of friends and have wonderful memories with the choir. I will never forget those days where we worked extremely hard for SYF and other school performances. We put in many hours of hard work for every performance, gave our best effort and always present for the training even though exams were approaching. During training, everyone was disciplined and would hone the techniques and skills taught until we were ready. Choir has changed me as a person, I became more confident and I gained the courage to lead my own section as a section leader and assist the chairperson in leading the choir. I am very glad that I have joined choir as I think that it has changed my life for the better.</p>
