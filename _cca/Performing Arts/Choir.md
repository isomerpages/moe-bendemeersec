<p style="text-align:justify">Bendemeer School Choir meets twice a week (Mondays & Wednesdays, 4 pm to 6 pm) to train our choir members. Besides learning the proper vocal production techniques, we train students’ leadership by assigning them to lead the warm-ups, choreograph the dance movements for performances and plan choir camp activities.  </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I have always loved to sing but I did not have the confidence to do so in front of others. The choir had helped me to hone not only my singing ability but also my confidence and leadership abilities. At first, the training was tiring and difficult, however I always looked forward to attending CCA as I get to do what I love to do and train together with my friends. In choir, I made numerous unforgettable memories and experiences that I would always be grateful for. I am truly glad that I decided to join the choir.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">During these 4 years of choir, I learnt a lot of new things, made a lot of friends and created wonderful memories with the choir. We’ve been through a lot together and I will never forget those days where we would work extremely hard for SYF and other school performances. We put in many hours of hard work for every performance and every choir member was always present for their training even though exams were nearing. Even though we couldn’t start CCA at the start of the year to practice for SYF, everyone still gave their best effort and worked really hard when we were able to resume training. During every training session, everyone was disciplined and  would hone the techniques and skills taught  until we were ready to record for SYF. After these 4 years, choir has changed me as a person, I became more confident and I gained the courage to lead my own section as a section leader and assist the chairperson in leading the choir. I am very glad that I have joined choir as I think that it has changed my life for the better.</p>
