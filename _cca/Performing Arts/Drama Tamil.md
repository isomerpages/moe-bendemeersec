<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">As the Tamil Drama president, I have learnt a lot of things in this journey of 4 years.  I have learnt to lead with pride. Participating in competitions like Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) has built confidence in me and has also made me understand the importance of teamwork. It instilled responsibility in me which has helped me to manage time even for studies efficiently.  I helped my CCA members learn new skills such as debating and acting by organizing various activities. It has also helped to build a stronger bond with my CCA members. Lastly, thank you to all the teachers who never failed to make our days and supporting pillars in all our paths.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">In the 4 years, I spent as a member of Drama Tamil CCA I learnt many skills related to the Indian culture. For example, kolam drawing, dance, and public speaking My appreciation of Tamil and Indian culture has increased after these 4 years. I was presented with many opportunities to guide and lead my juniors in many programs. It was a great experience indeed!</p>
