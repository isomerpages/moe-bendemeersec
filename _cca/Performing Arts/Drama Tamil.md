The goal of the Tamil Drama club is to provide various learning platforms in multiple domains to enable students to interact with others in Tamil. This allows them to inculcate culture, express their creativity and feel joy through the activities.



The vision of the Tamil Drama CCA is to provide a stimulating learning environment where all students work towards a common goal by challenging themselves to fulfill their fullest potential, understand more about the Language, Culture, Literature and Arts and become a more confident person to serve the community.

#### About our CCA

It aims to inspire the students to have a deeper understanding of learning the Tamil Language, Culture, and harnessing technology in learning the Tamil language, literature, traditional arts, and traditional games through experiential learning. Skype or Googlemeet or Zoom are used for connecting with experts from Malaysia, India and other countries.

All the programs place strong emphasis on creativity, collaboration and risk taking. Its inclusive, practical and challenging nature creates a dynamic and inspiring learning environment and equips students with interactive and communication skills that will enrich their perspectives.

We provide an authentic and pragmatic learning experience for students. The curriculum is designed in the following domains.

#### Cluster School Programme

The Drama Tamil student leaders were given a platform to display their talents and to develop leadership qualities.  In ‘Muthukoodal 2019 and 2020’ language and culture camp for cluster school our students leaders were in charge of certain segments. They have done well and gained a wider level of experience.

*I am very happy after joining this cca as it provided me with many opportunities to showcase my talent, taught me to believe in myself and strive to achieve many things. Having gained values like perseverance, resilience and confidence, helped me to overcome challenges and when I face difficulties managing my studies. I was able to bond and interact with my juniors and seniors and having a whale of time with them during CCA. I have learnt to believe and have confidence in myself when executing a plan or when giving presentations. I learnt to understand my peers better and communicate better with them. Participating in competitions and practising for that requires a lot of skills, time and hard work. The Navarasam team worked together and won the champion trophy for our school. I was delighted to get the Tamil Drama Chairperson shield during speech day when I was secondary 3. It was rewarding receiving the award because I know I worked hard for it!*

*Drama Tamil taught me more about my culture and the meaning behind each activity. The activities planned during the camp were really engaging and was a very useful way to learn about the culture and to be precise about details. The external competitions allowed students to discover their strengths and discover their true potential. For me, this CCA taught me to be more open and confident when I stepped up to participate in the Singapore Youth Festival Indian Dance. Dancing at the centre front showed me what I was capable of. Besides SYF, there was also an app creation competition which allowed me to apply my culture on the digital network. It required team effort. SYF 2021 taught me the values of sportsmanship and courage. Participating in 2021 SYF Indian dance was fun and rewarding experience, especially since we won the certificate of Distinction. There were many stumbles along the way and on the actual day itself as a student was absent we looked for alternative ways such as changing the formation and certain hand gestures to cover up the absence of the student. The 4 year journey has helped me experienced culture, important values and showed me my potential.*

*I recall when I was in Sec 1, going around school, looking at the colourful CCA booths and wondering which booth would intrigue me the most. That was when one of the seniors convinced me to visit the Tamil Drama booth. I instantly fell in love with the warm and welcoming camaraderie among the members and chose Tamil Drama as my CCA. In my lower secondary years where I felt like I was struggling to blend in with my class, the Tamil Drama Club treated me like I was a part of their family, which gave me motivation to move forward. Tamil Drama has never let me down and I found myself constantly signing up and competing with my peers to participate in competitions. My strong interest in both the Tamil language and my CCA pushed me to clinch a certificate for a composition writing competition. My favourite experience was when I was rehearsing for my SYF in 2019.* 

*This opportunity gave me the chance to interact with my seniors and find new companions, although  we didn’t achieve distinction that year we really found the overall experience pleasant and motivating. These experiences I gained from my CCA helped me hone my leadership and communication skills which eventually helped me qualify for the Vice Chairperson role in the CCA. My journey as a leader in Tamil drama was rewrding and unique at the same time. Bonding with my juniors is definitely what I would treasure the most. I hope that my overall experience in Tamil Drama acts as a testimony for the CCA’s likability and prompt more  students to join this CCA.*
