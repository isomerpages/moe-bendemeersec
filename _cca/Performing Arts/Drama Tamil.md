<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">Participating in the Drama Tamil had a significant positive impact on me as it led me to discover numerous new things. I take great pride in both myself and my fellow CCA members for our dedicated efforts that have brought us to where we are today. Throughout our journey, we remained a cohesive team, supporting and encouraging one another during both favorable and challenging times. Taking on the role of a leader has enhanced my self-confidence in expressing my thoughts and taught me how to effectively engage with people from various backgrounds. My patience has greatly improved, proving to be a valuable skill.  The SYF practice, which demanded immense dedication, also taught me the importance of responsible leadership and the value of teamwork.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">In my four years in Drama Tamil, I have learned more about Indian traditions, such as Kolam drawing and Therukoothu. Furthermore, participating in SYF has made me more confident and helped me realize the importance of teamwork. Lastly, I would like to thank the teachers who have always been a supporting pillar in our journey</p>
