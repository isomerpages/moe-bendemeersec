<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">As the Tamil Drama president, I have learnt a lot of things in this journey of 4 years.  I have learnt to lead with pride. Participating in competitions like Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) has built confidence in me and has also made me understand the importance of teamwork. It instilled responsibility in me which has helped me to manage time even for studies efficiently.  I helped my CCA members learn new skills such as debating and acting by organizing various activities. It has also helped to build a stronger bond with my CCA members. Lastly, thank you to all the teachers who never failed to make our days and supporting pillars in all our paths.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">Drama Tamil taught me more about my culture and the meaning behind each activity. The activities planned during the camp were really engaging and was a very useful way to learn about the culture and to be precise about details. The external competitions allowed students to discover their strengths and discover their true potential. For me, this CCA taught me to be more open and confident when I stepped up to participate in the Singapore Youth Festival Indian Dance. Dancing at the centre front showed me what I was capable of. Besides SYF, there was also an app creation competition which allowed me to apply my culture on the digital network. It required team effort. SYF 2021 taught me the values of sportsmanship and courage. Participating in 2021 SYF Indian dance was fun and rewarding experience, especially since we won the certificate of Distinction. There were many stumbles along the way and on the actual day itself as a student was absent we looked for alternative ways such as changing the formation and certain hand gestures to cover up the absence of the student. The 4 year journey has helped me experienced culture, important values and showed me my potential.</p>

CCA Vice-Chairperson 2020-2021**



<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I recall when I was in Sec 1, going around school, looking at the colourful CCA booths and wondering which booth would intrigue me the most. That was when one of the seniors convinced me to visit the Tamil Drama booth. I instantly fell in love with the warm and welcoming camaraderie among the members and chose Tamil Drama as my CCA. In my lower secondary years where I felt like I was struggling to blend in with my class, the Tamil Drama Club treated me like I was a part of their family, which gave me motivation to move forward. Tamil Drama has never let me down and I found myself constantly signing up and competing with my peers to participate in competitions. My strong interest in both the Tamil language and my CCA pushed me to clinch a certificate for a composition writing competition. My favourite experience was when I was rehearsing for my SYF in 2019.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">This opportunity gave me the chance to interact with my seniors and find new companions, although  we didn’t achieve distinction that year we really found the overall experience pleasant and motivating. These experiences I gained from my CCA helped me hone my leadership and communication skills which eventually helped me qualify for the Vice Chairperson role in the CCA. My journey as a leader in Tamil drama was rewrding and unique at the same time. Bonding with my juniors is definitely what I would treasure the most. I hope that my overall experience in Tamil Drama acts as a testimony for the CCA’s likability and prompt more  students to join this CCA.</p>
