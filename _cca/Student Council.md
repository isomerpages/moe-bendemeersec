<p style="text-align:justify"> 2022 has seen the resumption of many activities, which has provided our Student Councilors with many valuable opportunities to plan and carry out events for the school. Here are some of the highlights!</p>

**Secondary 1 Orientation Camp**<br>
**Secondary 1 SC Interview Camp**<br>
**Presidential Campaign**<br>
**Student Leaders Investiture**<br>
**June Holiday Leadership Workshop**<br>

<p style="text-align:justify">With the easing of covid measures, our Secondary Three leaders finally experienced their first face to face leadership workshop in Sentosa. They were challenged from the get-go as they took on low element tasks and a kayaking expedition into the open sea. Our leaders not only built resilience but also communication skills and team spirit!

##### **LLP Green Movement**

<p style="text-align:justify">Student Council’s Green Movement marked the first student-led effort to increase the school’s effort towards sustainability. The Secondary Two councilors designed and put up green-related posters around the school while our Secondary Three councilors spent the entire Term 2 planning for this week-long movement which came to fruition in Term 3. Our leaders held a school-wide assembly programme educating the school population about the importance of conservation and sustainability. This was followed by activities such as quizzes and competitions that students participated in to boost their knowledge and recycling efforts. At the end of the week, our councilors collected a whopping 839 pieces of plastic, amounting to 18 kg of waste. The success of the Green Movement also led to a collaboration between Bendemeer Secondary School and Environmental Solutions Asia.</p>




##### **Racial Harmony Day (21 July)**

<p style="text-align:justify">The school enjoyed their first Racial Harmony Day celebrations in over 2 years- students came to school decked in multicultural costumes, played ethnic games such as Chapteh, and even got to participate in Best Dressed competitions. This was all planned and executed by the Student Councilors! As measures further ease, the Student Council looks forward to planning more of such events and activities for the school!!</p>

##### **Teacher’s Day Celebration**
<p style="text-align:justify">After 2 years, the school was finally able to gather all together in the school hall to celebrate our teachers. The Student Council filmed videos and planned games, quizzes and even a concert put up by the Performing Arts CCAs.

##### **Leadership Workshop** 
<p style="text-align:justify">As a post-exam activity, students participated in a leadership workshop on 14 October that helped them to understand the five practices of the Leadership Challenge (Inspire a Shared Vision, Model the Way, Challenge the Process, Encourage the Heart and Enable Others to Act) and how to apply them in their capacity as student leaders. </p>
