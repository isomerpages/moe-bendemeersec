2021 has indeed been a challenging year for the Student Councillors but they still managed to carry out self-directed activities amid these challenging times. As we bid farewell to our graduating students, we would like to acknowledge their contributions as well as the contributions of our juniors.

The Sec 4s went into the sec 1 classes to conduct the annual recruitment talk and conducted interviews via Zoom. Conducting the interviews virtually was a new and exciting experience for them and they fully embraced the challenge.

Meanwhile, the Sec 2 and 3 SCs have also been busy planning their Learning for Life Programme (LLP) projects in order to raise awareness among our fellow Bendemeerians on issues like cyberbullying, stress management and animal abuse.

We look forward to another year of leading and being role models to all Bendemeerians.
