<p style="text-align:justify">This year, our Infocomm Club members took part in the Singapore Energy Grand Challenge (Youth). In its second year, this year’s theme was “How would your carbon-free school or neighbourhood in Singapore look like in 2050?”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Using the Minecraft: Education Edition (M:EE) software, students were asked to create their ideal Energy World and showcase their Energy Story aspirations for Singapore, with a focus on sustainability and low-carbon solutions. Our Infocomm students drew inspiration from various energy-saving technologies already implemented in our school as well as what they have observed in buildings around Singapore.</p>

Learning Journey

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I feel creative and inspired from my CCA training. I like building on Minecraft and enjoy the process of building with my friends. This is because we can solve difficult problems, as well as coming up with different ideas to solve problems. When we entered the competition, we were pleasantly surprised to emerge as semi-finalists.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">We got inspiration modelling after US-styled schools and enjoyed the process building block by block in the competition. I enjoyed the team work with my friends and was pleasantly surprised to emerge as semi-finalists. I was glad our hard work paid off.</p>
