<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">After attending the Infocomm Club Student Leader Conference, I have learnt many different values that can be apply in my daily lives such as Professionalism, Perseverance, Resilience, and Respect and I have also gotten several inspiration from the famous artists after listening to them about their challenges and how they overcome it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">During the whole programme, I have learn a lot of thing such as coding, game making , online security and about the different types of hackers.Furthermore other than having fun making new games by ourselves and we are also able to learn how to protect ourselves online which is very important.</p>

**- Zhixin, 3R2**
 
 
<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">From the Student Leaders Conference, I learnt more about tech and the media. Jian Hao Tan, one of my favourite YouTubers, was there to talk about how he started his channel, and how it grew to the popular channel we all know. There were also other speakers there to tell us more about ICT. Overall it was very fun to attend the conference.</p>
