The Covid-19 pandemic and constant disruptions have both immensely impacted our training since mid-2020. However, the Tchoukball team has adapted and continually found ways to ensure that all our players grow in technical skill, physical ability, and mental strength. Through taking a “Back to Basics” approach, we have taken this time of disruption as a good chance to train up our fundamentals and fitness. When the time to resume full training and competitions comes back around, we will be ready to go out there and fight for the school!

"*I learnt from the competitions and training that no matter how tough the competition or training is, you have to put in effort and try your very best and not give up. I also learnt that winning is not everything to aim for in a match – doing our best and being proud of ourselves after the game is what we should aim for.*"

**-Lim An Qi, Bendemeer Tchoukball Alumni.**
 
"*I learnt the importance of punctuality, because if one member is missing the whole team cannot train well as a team. I realised the importance of teamwork because Tchoukball is a team game that requires everyone to contribute.*"

**-Isabella Shem, Bendemeer Tchoukball Team.**

"*It all starts with curiosity and the hunger to know more about this sport that little people know of. As it progresses, you realize that the variety of styles and techniques are indefinite. Slowly, passion plays a huge role in the sport. But players like me, face huge walls and obstacles that take a lot of hustle to overcome. But it is for the best as it helps us to grow even better individually. Personally I struggled with lots of distractions in secondary school to the point where I felt really lost. However, training helped me to clear my mind and focus on the long term goal and eventually I managed to better understand myself and the problems I was facing. With no interest in studies and no drive, I was reluctant to even try and was ready to give up. Training helped me back on track and realize reality, that my future was at stake. I started putting in more effort and always compared it to my training. “Am I trying my best?”. In my entire secondary school life I have never passed math once. But this time, I passed the O levels. Which was not only the ultimate goal for me, but also a boost in self confidence.*"
