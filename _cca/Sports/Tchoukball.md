<p style="text-align:justify">
While Tchoukball is a relatively new sport in Singapore, it was developed in the 1970s by Swiss biologist Hermann Brandt. Bendemeer Secondary School introduced the sport through our CCAs sine 2010 and has been holding it to high standards, instilling character and leadership traits in its members. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">
Bendemeer Secondary School is well known to have nurtured many national players, coaches and referees in the sport. In fact, many of the members go on to be selected for the National and National Youth Development teams. Our own alumnus is currently serving as the President of the Tchoukball Association of Singapore (TBAS). The alumnus plays an important part in the development of our students as they are always training together with the current students so as to help them improve both in techniques and character. </p>
