The Covid-19 pandemic and constant disruptions have both immensely impacted our training since mid-2020. However, the Tchoukball team has adapted and continually found ways to ensure that all our players grow in technical skill, physical ability, and mental strength. Through taking a “Back to Basics” approach, we have taken this time of disruption as a good chance to train up our fundamentals and fitness. When the time to resume full training and competitions comes back around, we will be ready to go out there and fight for the school!</p>

1. I learned that following instructions is important as they are there for a reason.  Knowing opponent shots and their angles and adapt to it is important because defending also come before attacking.  Lastly, I learned that cupping together is important to prevent the ball from passing through both defenders. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">2. Shooting into gaps, getting most of my shots in and blasting a power shot when the defenders hug the line and try to guard all my shooting angles are some of things I well during the competition. I managed to save most of the balls in my second line rebounds position.  </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">3. I want to work on our communication as in counting the number of passes and number of people defending our attacker so we can switch court and have a higher chance of scoring. For example, if my opponent went into the first line to defend, I could have signaled to my teammate to pass me the ball to increase the chance of scoring  Therefore, from the next training onwards, I will start practicing during training no matter whether it is match play or etc so it will be neutral in competition too.</p>

Remain calm and alert during the game so that you dont panic and make mistakes. </p>
