#### Fun & Exciting Training Sessions

We watched, awed, as the ball sailed across in the air, and hear our passionate young Bendemeerian footballers screech in excitement at the perfect pass, hoping to score a goal. Alas! Our skillful goalkeeper, Braydon, catches the ball by the skin of his teeth, as his teammates heave a sigh of relief!

Our students look forward to friendly matches as they put to practice what they have learnt after an hour of intense practice. Lower secondary footballers focus on the basics of football such as passing, shooting, and heading. At the upper secondary level, there are deliberate attempts to infuse more tactical awareness into the trainings with more emphasis on situational plays. Coaches try to create a fun yet competitive environment in training sessions through many small-sided games. The players keep track of their number of assists and goals in these small-sided games and they always try to outdo one another at every session!

*“During training, we learn dribbling, ball mastery and how to control the space. We especially enjoy the friendly matches that help us to bond as a team!”* **-Khafidz, Secondary One Footballer.**

#### Character Building through Sports

Character building is emphasised in every aspect of our Football CCA where our teachers and coaches emphasise the importance of values such as integrity, respect, responsibility and care for others. All our passionate young footballers have the drive to succeed and constantly put in the effort to learn and improve. We place special emphasis on values like striving for excellence and having the resilience to bounce back from challenges and to train even harder.

*“Our teachers are very caring towards the players and will always seek to help them develop holistically as a footballer. Our coaches are very passionate about the game and are very motivated to help the footballers improve. It helps that they are also well qualified not just in terms of their qualifications but in coaching experience as well. Our teachers and coaches have helped to create a family culture in the team where everyone does their part to help the team move forward as One Bendemeer.”* 
**-Mr. Lee Chen Siang, Teacher-in-charge of Bendemeer Football.**

#### Experienced Coaches in Specialised Fields

*“As a goalkeeper I feel lucky to have a specialised goalkeeping coach brought in to train goalkeepers. We play matches similar to a competitive game. The coaches assess the performance of each player and help us improve on our weaknesses after the match. We constantly train to build stamina and agility, improve our techniques and work on our game strategy to prepare for a possible tournament season next year.”*   **-Braydon Ng, Bendemeer Football Team Goalkeeper.**

#### Striving for Excellence

*“Football season in 2019 was one filled with ups and downs as well as learning opportunities. Despite not winning the championships and having only a handful of players, we still managed to prove that we were definitely a force to be reckoned with. I feel that it was a great experience for everyone and we bonded very well as a team. Most importantly, we had fun. At the same time, I would like to thank our coach and teachers for motivating and guiding us along the way.”* **-Chong Shing, Alumni of Bendemeer Football Team.**

As the whistle blew, Hafiz, with sweat dripping down his face, pumped his fist in the air and said, “Yay! We scored 2 goals!” The excitement was contagious as the winners basked in their victory. Every soccer match brings an adrenaline rush to these passionate young footballers and that’s what they love about Bendemeer Football.

Training under the hot sun is hard work but our passionate players persevere through the challenges.
