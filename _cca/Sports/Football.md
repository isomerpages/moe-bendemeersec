*“...This year, the school went on board with Unleash The Roar! and we are now one of the ten School Football Academies (SFAs) in Singapore. The coaches helped us to improve both technically and tactically, and inspired every member of the team to be the best footballer we can be. We trained hard, listened to coaches even harder and pushed one another even when we felt demotivated with events happening in our personal lives. As the Captain of the team, I instilled motivation amongst my teammates. Even when we were losing, I encouraged the team to press on and give their best. With everyone working for a common goal, the team was able to emerge victorious in games where the odds were stacked against us. This year, we reached the Quarter-finals of League 2 and it was a very special moment for the whole team…”*

 *“...The partnership with SportSG and Football Association of Singapore (FAS) has given us many opportunities to grow. We were able to experience playing football in National Stadium during the SFA Football Fiesta earlier this year in January. The coaches are always encouraging. Now, we not only have strong relationships with our teachers, we are also close with our coaches and teammates. Participating in B Boys NSG games this year has taught me the importance of resilience as we should always give our very best till the end…”*
