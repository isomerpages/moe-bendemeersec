Since the Circuit Breaker was declared last year, the school’s Cross Country team has been facing unprecedented challenges. The team has not been able to participate in competitions and even the regular team training sessions have also been disrupted.  Indeed, the strength and resilience of the team have never been tested and stretched to such extent before until now.

However, in April 2021, the team was given the opportunity to participate in the Virtual Inter-School Challenge 2021.  Despite having a huge disadvantage of running on turf grass which provides little friction, the team put in their best and performed beyond expectations. Many of those who took part managed to attain their personal best timing, Koh Jin En (4R1) came in 14th  place for the B Girls Category while for the B Boys’ Category, both Rizyan Idzhar (3R8) and P Sakteeshwaren (4R3) emerged 69th place with the same exact timing.

Spurred by the abovementioned performance, the team continues to persevere in training to prepare for competitions in 2022, in pursuit of greater heights of excellence.

*My experience in being part of Bendemeer Secondary School Cross Country CCA has been undeniably enriching and wonderful. I am extremely grateful for the values that have been instilled in me, such as responsibility and resilience. I learned to be responsible for my personal growth and improvement, as well as stepping out of my comfort zone, and persisting till the end, regardless of difficulties and challenges. These values have been ultimately useful to me not only in the sport of running but also in my studies. The training sessions are indeed exhausting, however, with the support from coach, teachers and friends, things become meaningful and worth looking forward to. During the Virtual Inter-school Challenge that took place earlier this year, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to take part in my first race. It was definitely an unforgettable event as I have certainly learned my lesson and gained experiences from it. In conclusion, I will continue to work hard and put in consistent effort in all aspects.*

*Cross Country has helped me gain many values that are not only important for me to do my best in the CCA, but it also helps me in my lifelong learning. We learn about discipline, accountability, resilience, having the mindset to do what is right, being responsible for our own diets and health, pushing on even if others may be mentally pulling us down, and finally, putting in our maximum effort in each training. All that I learned prepared me well to perform my best during the Virtual Inter-school Challenge 2021 in April. I am grateful for the cheers I got from my team, teachers and coach, as they spurred me on further to pull through and finish the race.*

*My most valuable takeaway from this journey was the power of passion. Passion determines the amount of effort one is willing to put into anything one does. It pushes me to strive for excellence in both Cross Country and my studies, and helps my teammates and I to pull through mentally challenging training sessions, during which we even thought we would never make it out alive at times!  Most importantly, it is the core of our CCA which binds us together to make us one big family.*
