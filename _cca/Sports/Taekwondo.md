<p style="text-align:justify">Due to the COVID-19 situation, the recruitment for secondary one students was done online. We had to produce a video to promote the CCA.  Members and the coach came up with a few performances that were being video-recorded. It honed the skills of the tech-savvy students who contributed to the whole process of video-recording, the editing and the inclusion of text and music. It was indeed a well-produced video, showcasing the skills that the members have acquired. We managed to recruit 14 secondary one students to join the CCA.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Training continued through semester one but due to a restriction on the number of students who can attend training, members had to be rostered and thus members had a reduced number of training hours.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Every year, our members train hard for two Taekwondo competitions, the National School Games and the Whampoa Community Club Taekwondo Competition. Through participation in competitions, our students gain valuable lessons of discipline, sportsmanship and teamwork, which develop them holistically. Therefore, we were very glad when it was announced that the National School Games would be carried out this year, albeit with strict Safe Management Measures.</p>

It was only for members from Division B and only for the Poomsae events. Our members were video-recorded on assigned time slots and judging was done based on the videos. It was a totally new experience for those who took part. Our hard work paid off as we clinched two Gold, one Silver and 5 Bronze medals.</p>


<p style="text-align:justify">We also bid a fond farewell to the graduating members who are preparing for their GCE O and N level examinations. We have appointed the new Captain and Vice-Captains to take over the leadership of the CCA.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">We are extremely proud of our members as they adapt to the disruptions for the last two years and their continued enthusiasm in training and the desire to improve their skills in Taekwondo.  </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">Through these four years in Taekwondo CCA, I have seen the club grow stronger in the areas of achievement and see a stronger bond among members. Joining Taekwondo CCA has made me stronger mentally and physically as I train hard for competitions and I learnt not to give up easily when things do not go my way.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">During our training, we have to practise our kicks and Poomsae pattern routine well so as to synchronize our movement with fellow team mates. Through these training sessions it bonds us together as a club, along with our Coach who is friendly and who helps us whenever we need guidance. Through my participation in Taekwondo CCA, I have learnt many important life values and I have made many good friends.</p>

**- Lim Keyi (Captain)**

 
<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">In my four years of Taekwondo training, besides learning self-defence, I have learnt values like teamwork, perseverance, and responsibility. As a Vice-Captain, I was tasked to co-ordinate the designing and the production of the CCA T-shirts, collecting forms and preparing for the secondary one orientation programme. Covid-19 has affected us in many ways. We couldnâ€™t train much because of the restrictions. We were so excited when we learned that we could participate in the National Schools Games. Everyone persevered and worked very hard. The team bonded very well and supported each other. Since this was my last competition, I gave my best at every training and motivated my teammates so that we were all able to go through this competition and finish Taekwondo CCA on a high note. All in all, my time spent in Taekwondo CCA has been worthwhile and I am grateful for this learning opportunity.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">My experience in Taekwondo has been one of the most enjoyable experience of my Secondary School life. I am proud to say that making Taekwondo my first choice was correct. Taekwondo is not merely a form of martial arts, but rather, an opportunity for me to gain leadership skills and to acquire values of discipline and resilience. My skills as a CCA leader would be challenged whenever there was an upcoming competition. Besides overcoming my own difficulties in memorising the Poomsae pattern routine, I have to teach my juniors and motivate them to persevere and be determined to win the competition. All in all, Taekwondo is a CCA that has challenged me, both physically and mentally.</p>
