<p style="text-align:justify">With relaxed safety measures, training has returned to normalcy. We started the year with the recruitment of seventeen secondary one students through a video that was prepared by our members.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Members were excited when the National School Games and the Kallang Community Club Taekwondo Competition resumed albeit with some Safe Management Measures.  Through participation in these competitions, our members could gain the valuable lessons of discipline, sportsmanship and teamwork, which develop them holistically.

Our members trained hard to perfect their routines, especially in synchronising with team members for the team events. We managed to obtain one silver and three bronze medals for the National Schools Games and we were also the Overall Champion for the Kallang Community Club Taekwondo Competition. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">We bid farewell to the graduating members who are preparing for their GCE O and N level examinations. We have appointed the new Captain and Vice-Captains to take over the leadership of the CCA.  </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">We are extremely proud of our members as they adapt to the disruptions for the last two years and their continued enthusiasm in training and the desire to improve their skills in Taekwondo. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Every year, our members train hard for two Taekwondo competitions, the National School Games and the Whampoa Community Club Taekwondo Competition. Through participation in competitions, our students gain valuable lessons of discipline, sportsmanship and teamwork, which develop them holistically. Therefore, we were very glad when it was announced that the National School Games would be carried out this year, albeit with strict Safe Management Measures.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">
My experience in Taekwondo has been one of the most enjoyable experience of my secondary school life. I am proud to say that making Taekwondo my first choice was correct. Taekwondo is not merely a form of martial arts, but rather, an opportunity for me to gain leadership skills and to acquire values of discipline and resilience. My skills as a CCA leader would be challenged whenever there was an upcoming competition. Besides overcoming my own difficulties in memorising the Poomsae pattern routine, I have to teach my juniors and motivate them to persevere and be determined to win the competition. All in all, Taekwondo is a CCA that has challenged me, both physically and mentally. </p>

In my four years of Taekwondo training, besides learning self-defense, I have learnt values like teamwork, perseverance, and responsibility. As a vice captain, I was tasked to co-ordinate the designing and the production of the CCA T-shirts, administrative work and preparing for the secondary one orientation programme. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">Covid-19 has affected us in many ways. We couldn't train much because of the restrictions. We were so excited when we learned that we could participate in the National Schools Games. Everyone persevered and worked very hard. The team bonded very well and supported each other. Since this was my last competition, I gave my best at every training and motivated my teammates so that we were all able to go through this competition and finish Taekwondo CCA on a high note. All in all, my time spent in Taekwondo CCA has been worthwhile and I am grateful for this learning opportunity. </p>
