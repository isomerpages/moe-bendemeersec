<p style="text-align:justify">The Taekwondo CCA has been participating in the National Schools Games and the Whampoa and Kallang Community Club Taekwondo Championships for many years. The members undergo rigorous training to improve their accuracy in executing the Poomsae routines as well as team coordination in the team events. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Our members were able to do well and have achieved many medals. But for those who have not done so, they have gained much experience through their participation and they would be motivated to further improve themselves in order to compete at a higher level. </p>

***Personal Reflections***
<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">
Looking back, I’ve progressed a lot from that timid ‘White Belter’ way back in Secondary one to be the CCA captain today. One of the best things about the Taekwondo club is that you're never alone. You will always have someone there to encourage you, to push you to perform to the very best of your ability. Seeing the other members train is also an inspiration to me to train harder. In addition, it motivates me to become a better leader to guide my fellow members throughout their journey.
In my four years of Taekwondo training, it has provided me with sporting and self-defence abilities and has given me an edge in my daily life, with its merits as a martial art sport of self-discipline, perseverance, and resilience. All in all, my experience in Taekwondo has been one of the most enjoyable experiences of my secondary school life. I’m proud to say that I’m part of the Taekwondo family! </p>

Taekwondo is a very dynamic CCA and many of us trained very hard to be disciplined. I was chosen to be the Vice-Captain in Taekwondo, assisting my coach in training the junior members. This responsibility has made me more patient and well mannered. Moreover, it has helped boost my confidence in interacting with people and has made me more enthusiastic in learning Taekwondo. </p>
