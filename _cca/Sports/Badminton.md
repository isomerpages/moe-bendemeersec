<p style="text-align:justify">
Badminton has been very popular among Bendemeerians for years. The training always gives members a good muscle stretching and strong mind stimulation after a long day. Teams  willingly allow more players to join in as there are only 4 Badminton courts at the Indoor Sports Hall and enjoy the camaraderie. After a 1 hour game, you can see the perseverance as they carry on the match all sweaty.  </p>

Many of the members are from the Secondary 4 and 5 cohort, almost half being girls. They love how they could outwit each other in the matches, as they try to coax more girls to join them.   </p>

#### Student Reflections
<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">
From my experiences as being captain of Badminton, reminding members to be on time is an important duty. As for the training, I play hard and laugh hard, that is a big benefit.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">Badminton CCA was not my choice but seeing how much we can play and goof around in a safe environment is definitely something I like. </p>
