Badminton gives students opportunities to adopt an active lifestyle and develop flexibility. At the same time it instils focus and good hand-eye coordination. This yearâ€™s CCA sessions started with that aim in mind, yet keeping it fun and challenging for the members.</p>

Basic Strokes
<p style="text-align:justify">
Badminton is only offered to Upper Secondary students. Training sessions are held every Tuesday. This year also saw a very large cohort from the upper secondary levels. They played enthusiastically, keeping all the courts in the ISH fully occupied and even playing on the sidelines. Many had to wait to get their turn to play.</p>

	All our members thoroughly enjoyed the sessions and used it to release some stress from their studies. CCA members agreed the foundational skills should be continued yearly.</p>

#### Student Reflections
<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">
Badminton is a fun CCA, it gives me a lot of practise I need for my external competitions I take part in. It has been a fun and beneficial 3 years in badminton. Many teachers say I look very disciplined when I play Badminton, which will seep into my studies.</p>
