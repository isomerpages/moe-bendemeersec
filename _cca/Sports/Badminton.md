Badminton gives our students good flexibility and a good joint work-out. In addition, fast hand and eye coordination is key in predicting and delivering accurate shots. No badminton player will succeed without building up their stamina, for long bouts lasting 2-3 hours. This yearâ€™s CCA sessions started with that aim in mind, at the same time keeping it fun, relaxing and challenging for the members.n</p>

Training sessions were held every Tuesday with all of our upper secondary students training from 4-6pm. This year also saw a very large cohort from the graduating students. They played enthusiastically and kept attending CCA sessions even after CCA stood down. </p>

All our members thoroughly enjoyed the sessions and used it to relieve some stress from their studies. CCA members agreed the fun and non-competitive aspects of the training was what they cherished most.</p>

From my experiences as being captain of Badminton, its is delightful to compete against fellow CCA mates and friends. Being able to come together for badminton practice is what I look forward to each week. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">Badminton CCA is a time to come together with friends to play and relieve any stress after long hours of lessons. Badminton also gives the opportunity to create new bonds and potentially learn from others and have fun. </p>
