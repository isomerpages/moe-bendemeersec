<p style="text-align:justify">Bendemeer Secondary Sepak Takraw as a CCA provides boys with a keen interest in the sport a platform to not only enhance their playing skills but to have a co-curricular activity that is both interesting and challenging. Over the years, the boys are expected to demonstrate camaraderie, team work and sportsmanship, especially when representing the school at competitions. As they experience sports at a competitive level, the school hopes to prepare them psychologically for future sporting endeavours as they move on to higher educational institutions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The CCA comprises Secondary 1 to Secondary 4 students who are enthusiastic and motivated to learn the skills of the sport. The students play the game at recreational and competitive level. They are trained, guided and supervised by 3 dedicated teachers and a coach.</p> 

<p style="text-align:justify">Bendemeer Sepak Takraw kicked start the year by recruiting new members from Secondary One through skill testing sessions during the orientation week. After several sessions of intensive trainings, we had our friendly matches between the ‘B’ and ‘C’ division boys to assess our players’ readiness and competiveness.  These matches and trainings provide us with a great opportunity to build good and strong friendship with others. It also gives the new members a good platform for team bonding.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Trainings are conducted two times a week. They are held on Mondays and Wednesdays.  During training, the team not only focuses on the athletic aspects critical to the sport but also on character bulding and leadership. School values such as resilience, respect and integrity are instilled in every player throughout the training sessions. Very often, the boys looked forward to these trainings and turned up even earlier before training started. Trainings may be exhausting and gruelling but the boys enjoyed themselves and persevered throughout the training sessions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The teachers and coaches have built a very strong rapport with these boys and often motivated and encouraged them not only in terms of having good sportsmanship but also on character-building.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">This year is an unforgetable moment for me as it is my first time taking part in a competition and getting to know more about Sepak Takraw. I learnt a lot and will continue to improve my skills in Sepak Takraw. I am not shy to seek help from my team mates to be a better player.</p>

**- Mohamed Zulazim Bin Zulkifli - (3R8)**

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I train hard in Sepak Takraw and has improved basic juggling skills and communication skills too . Without these skills, we will not be able to play well during the competitive matches . My advice to anybody reading this, never give up or lose hope . Just enjoy your CCA and even if you lose, just train harder next time.</p>

**- Muhammad Firdaus Bin Repin – (2R6)**

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">The training for Sepak Takraw this year was hard and tiring but it was also rewarding as we were able to hone our basic skills. Even though occasionally I was a reserve player during the national school games competitions, I can see that my team mates used the skills they have learnt from training, resulting in some wins for our team.</p>

**- Muhammad Riyan Rifqi Bin Rahman – (2R5)**

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">This is my first time playing Sepak Takraw as a CCA. It was a great experience as I have learnt a lot from my coach and team mates. Although the training was tiring, it was also fun. We played matches against our own team mates. In this way, we practised how to upgrade our skills and be ready for the coming competitions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I am happy that despite the pandemic situation, I manage to play Sepak takraw to represent the school as this will be my last year with the school. We were not able to train much due to the occasional school closure for students, however we gave our best during the available training sessions and the competition. As the Team Captain, I can say that we  have forged stronger ties and hope our friendships will last beyond the secondary school years.</p>

**- Ayob Bin Mohd Jaaffar , Team Captain – B Division (4R8)**

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I love playing Sepak takraw. It teaches me skills and the importance of teamwork. It also teaches me to be more self-disciplined and a motivator to my teammates especially during a game. Communication is an important aspect as we need to work together to win. Since I have started playing Sepak takraw, I have become a better player and a more importantly, a better student.</p>

**- Mohamed Zu’eirmanshah Bin Mohamed Nesani (4R5)**

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I like Sepak Takraw because there are many ‘cool’ tricks that you can learn to be a better player. The teachers and coach are friendly. If you need help to better yourself, the coach will be there to advise and provide guidance for you. I can say that my skills have improved over the years under his guidance and with constant practice.</p>
