<p style="text-align:justify">The Bendemeer Secondary Sepak Takraw is a CCA that provides our students with a keen interest in the sport a platform to not only enhance their playing skills but to have a CCA that is both interesting and challenging. Over the years, camaraderie, team work and sportsmanship is instilled, especially when representing the school at competitive levels. As they experience sports at a competitive level, the school hopes to prepare them psychologically for future sporting endeavours as they move on to higher educational institutions.</p>

Ready to strike!


<p style="text-align:justify">Our players are enthusiastic and motivated to learn the skills of the sport. The students play the game both recreationally and competitively. They are trained, guided and supervised by three dedicated teachers and a coach.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Bendemeer Sepak Takraw team kicked start the year by recruiting new members from Secondary One through skill testing trials during the Orientation week. After several sessions of intensive trainings, we had our friendly matches between the ‘B’ and ‘C’ division boys to assess our players’ readiness and competiveness.  These matches and trainings provide us with a great opportunity to build good and strong friendship with others. It also gives the new members a good platform for team bonding.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">During training, the team not only focuses on the athletic aspects critical to the sport but also on character building and leadership. School values such as resilience, respect and integrity are instilled in every player throughout the training sessions. Our athletes looked forward to these trainings and often turn up even before training starts. Trainings may be exhausting and gruelling but the boys always enjoy themselves and persevere throughout the training sessions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The teachers and coach have built a very strong rapport with these boys and often motivate and encourage them not only in terms of having good sportsmanship but also on character-building and studies.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I am happy that despite the pandemic, I managed to play Sepak takraw to represent the school as this will be my last year with the school. We were not able to train much due to the occasional school closure, however we gave our best during each training session and during the competition. As the team captain, I can say that we  have forged stronger ties and hope our friendships will last beyond our secondary school years.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I love playing Sepak takraw. It teaches me skills and the importance of teamwork. It also teaches me to be more self-disciplined and be a motivator to my teammates especially during a game. Communication is an important aspect as we need to work together to win. Since playing Sepak takraw, I have become a better player and a more important, a better student.</p>

**- Mohamed Zu’eirmanshah Bin Mohamed Nesani (4R5)**


<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I like Sepak takraw because there are many ‘cool’ tricks that you can learn to be a better player. The teachers and coach are friendly. If you need help to improve your skills, the coach will be there to advise and provide guidance for you. I can say that my skills have improved over the years with his guidance and constant practice.</p>
