<p style="text-align:justify">The National Cadet Corps is a military cadet corps youth organisation supported by the Singapore Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Education. Its aim is to mould cadets into one with a resilient mind, fit body and committed heart. Our key programmes include orienteering, urban operations training, live firing using SAR21 rifle and overseas hikes at Mt Ophir.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">2022 has been another fruitful year for Bendemeer NCC (Land) unit where we obtained Distinction for our annual Unit Recognition. This is testament to the hard work and commitment put in by our teacher officers, cadet officers, specialists and cadets.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">With the easing of restrictions and returning to normalcy, our NCC cadets were able to take part in a wide range of activities which challenged them both mentally and physically. Earlier this year, our cadets managed to carry out air rifle shoot at an indoor range where they got to hone their marksmanship skills. Selected cadets also had the opportunity to attend the One Star Kayaking Course. The experience instilled values of perseverance and resilience in our cadets and gave them a sense of accomplishment when they completed the course. At the affirmation ceremony, junior cadets who just joined us this year were given the opportunity to handle various weapons including the SAR-21, Section Assault Weapon (SAW), General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG) and Matador. The cadets also had the chance to take photos with the SAF MP Command Outrider Motorcycles, don the anti-riot gear and interact with dogs from the Military Working Dog Unit. Furthermore, our Freestyle Drills team gave an impressive performance at the Annual Freestyle Drills Competition and it was definitely an eye-opening experience for our cadets. 3SG Bobby Leonard Gari Leonard has also been selected to represent the school as part of the marching contingent in the National Day Parade this year.   </p>


<p style="text-align:justify">All in all, it has been an eventful year for Bendemeer NCC (Land) unit. We will continue to challenge and develop our cadets as we build a NCC that is Nurturing, Committed and Cool.</p>

NCC Affirmation Ceremony


<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I am glad and thankful to have chosen NCC as my CCA. I have enjoyed every single activity that I have taken part in at NCC. I am also very grateful to have such supportive cadets of all levels around me. They have motivated me greatly and pushed me to do my very best during CCA. Without them, I do not think that my experience would have been as enjoyable. As Cadet Leaders, my team and I aspire to make the CCA as enjoyable as how our seniors have made our experiences to be. Overall NCC has shaped me to be a better person than I had originally been before joining. Despite being very tough and tiring, this experience would be something that I am going to miss in the long run.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">My experience with NCC so far has been wonderful. NCC has taught me a lot of things like how to be a leader as well as values such as responsibility, respect and resilience which shaped me into who I am today. Another reason why I like NCC is because of my platoon mates. At the beginning of sec 1, I did not know most of them but we bonded over time. Soon they made me look forward to coming for cca every week as it was very fun to be with them and we made a lot of great memories together. Before I joined NCC I was very unfit as I could not even finish my 2.4 km runs. But after all the encouragement from my platoon sergeants, it gave me the confidence to participate in all of the physical activities and now I am able to finish my 2.4 km in under 13 minutes. I can also do more than 30 push-ups all thanks to NCC. I plan to encourage all of my juniors to participate in physical activities like how my seniors used to encourage me.</p>
