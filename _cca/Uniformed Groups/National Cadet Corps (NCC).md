<p style="text-align:justify">The National Cadet Corps is a military cadet corps youth organisation supported by the Singapore Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Education. Its aim is to mould cadets into one with a resilient mind, fit body and committed heart. Our key programmes include orienteering, urban operations training, live firing using SAR21 rifle and overseas hikes at Mt Ophir.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Bendemeer Secondary Schoolâ€™s NCC unit was awarded Gold in the Best Unit Competition 2018 and Distinction at the annual Unit Recognition 2019. The annual Unit Recognition 2020 was waived due to Covid-19.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">2021 marks the 120th Anniversary of the National Cadet Corps. In line with the anniversary celebrations, our unit took part in a number of commemorative activities. Through the NCC120 Virtual Race, our cadets got to take ownership of their own fitness and strived to build a culture for fitness. Cadets also got to explore their creativity and express themselves, while strengthening their identity as a corps when they took part in the NCC120 TikTok Challenge. By doing the monthly fitness routine challenges, our cadets learnt to be confident individuals who will embrace discipline and perseverance when the going gets tough.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">All in all, it has been an eventful year for Bendemeer NCC (Land) unit. We will continue to challenge and develop our cadets as we build a NCC that is Nurturing, Committed and Cool.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">This year has been quite eventful as I was nominated to be the USM. As I had never gotten any leadership roles in my previous CCAs, I was at first quite petrified of leading the CCA to failure. Through the help of supportive Cadets, Master Sergeants and Instructors, I was able to gain confidence in being able to lead the CCA. Though I held a leadership role, it is not always smooth sailing. Cadets might be reluctant to follow orders or may need help. I always try to help whenever it is needed and try to resolve conflict. Even though being a USM may be tiring, I still enjoy being a leader.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">My experience with NCC this year has been an amazing journey. My fellow sec 3s and I  took over the CCA from the sec 4s and the first training we had after we took over did not go as smoothly as I had hoped but since then I think that everything has been improving. I hope as the ASM I that I can help and support the USM in leading our CCA as well as help out my fellow cadets.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I am Veenath from class, 3R2. I am in NCC as an Assistant Platoon Sargent. I am proud to be in NCC. Due to the decrease in the number of Covid-19 cases, NCC trainings have became physical that will benefit all the NCC Cadets. The biggest challenge came when the Sec 4s which were about to pass out of NCC due to their National Examinations. Sec 3s took over the NCC unit. Each of us were given positions of USM(Uniformed Sergeant Major), ASM, PS, APS, Section Commanders and Logistic Heads (Storeman). When it was the first time to take over, we faced several difficulties like confusion and fear, but we were able to organise interesting activities for the NCC cadets to enjoy, especially the new recruits.</p>
