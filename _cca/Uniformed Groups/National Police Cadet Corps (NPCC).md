The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) was formed in 1959 and has become one of the popular youth uniformed organisations in Singapore.

The mission of the National Police Cadet Corps is to develop our members to be active citizens and community leaders, by working in partnership with Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe.

NPCC cadets undergo various training in their 4-year stint, which include physical fitness training, foot-drills, camp-craft skills, camps, police knowledge courses and visits. Through challenging situations, our cadets hone their leadership qualities and are groomed to become leaders with strong character and positive social, moral and civic values.

Cadets’ achievements are recognised through attaining skill proficiency badges and rank promotion. Outstanding cadets will be nominated for the pinnacle SPF-NPCC Badge and promotion to the rank of Station Inspector.

The National Police Cadet Corps is a fulfilling and enriching co-curricular activity, one in which cadets learn and grow significantly in personal competencies and leadership.

*Being in NPCC for three years has taught me a lot of values and has nurtured me into a better person and a better leader. It has shown me the importance of leadership, teamwork, communication and responsibility. The most memorable experience has to be being in charge of the Secondary Two cadets. It was challenging to come up with lessons that the cadets would understand. It was a rocky road but I had my squadmates who were very helpful and it was an overall happy experience. Through tough times I have bonded with my squadmates, I had to step out of my comfort zone and this made me into a stronger person.*

*During the four years in NPCC I’ve learnt lots of things, skills and also have met new friends. When I first joined NPCC in Sec 1, I was really shy and did not really want to volunteer for anything. As the time passed, I got used to the environment. My seniors always had high expectations of us and I tried my very best to meet their expectations.*

*One of the memorable experiences I had was the Sec 2 Adventure training Camp at Pulau Ubin. It was challenging to build a tent as a group and we failed countless times while trying to do so. But we had to complete the tent, otherwise we would have no place to sleep at night.  Another memorable moment during the camp was the campfire, where we sang campfire songs at the top of our lungs and laughed our heads off at other groups’ performances.  The camp bonded everyone together and I learnt the value of resilience.*

*Taking over training as a sec 4 cadet leader was a daunting task. It was a huge responsibility having to train the juniors in their drills, setting expectations for them and learning how to build rapport with the juniors, earning their trust in me as a leader.  But taking over a squad forced me to grow and pushed my boundaries. I overcame my shyness in front of a squad and learnt how to manage conflicts with my peers. Along the way, I received a lot of invaluable advice from teachers and Cadet Inspectors. I am glad that I joined NPCC as I think that it is really a life changing experience for me.*

*Through NPCC, I have learnt to be more disciplined in my tasks given and became more confident in taking over my juniors. Communication is a very important skill especially when we have to resolve conflicts. As a Cadet Leader when I was in Sec 4, I had to break out of my comfort zone, and became more vocal and forthcoming during discussions with my squadmates and in leading my juniors. When I returned to NPCC as a Secondary 5 cadet, it gave me the opportunity to mentor the Sec 4 cadet leaders. The Sec 4 cadet leaders would often come to me for advice and I was able to build strong rapport with them even though I have not trained them personally in previous years. NPCC is an important aspect of my secondary school life. Apart from building strong friendships with my squadmates and juniors, I have evolved into a much more resilient, responsible and confident person.*

**- SSGT (NPCC) Subbiah (5R1)**


*Being in NPCC for 4 years has instilled values in me, nurtured me to be a better person and most importantly, a leader. It has taught me many crucial life skills which I did not know about before joining NPCC.  It has also improved my communication skills as cadets will be asked to work with other CCA’s and organise events. Through this journey, friendships were fostered and I met people from all walks of life. Despite tough trainings every week, I could see myself growing and gaining confidence in whatever I did. NPCC has given me the opportunity to be a leader and has become an essential part of my secondary school journey. I have had many enjoyable and unforgettable memories in this journey and sometimes I wish to go back to Secondary 1 to re-live these moments.*
