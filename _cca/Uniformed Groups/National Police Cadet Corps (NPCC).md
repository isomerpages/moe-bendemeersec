<p style="text-align:justify">The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) was formed in 1959 and is one of the longest standing uniformed youth organisations in Singapore today with a proud heritage. 
The mission of the National Police Cadet Corps is to develop our members to be active citizens and community leaders, by working in partnership with Singapore Police Force to fight crime and keep Singapore safe. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Through a variety of activities, the values of resilience, integrity, service, and excellence are inculcated in our youth. These values will enable them to develop into caring and responsible citizens with a sense of purpose to serve the community.
</p>


<p style="text-align:justify">

At the heart of our training principles is the 6A framework which provides direction for the training and development of all NPCC members. The 6As (AWARE, ACQUIRE, ACTUATE, ASPIRE, ACHIEVE and AIM) shows the focus for members at each level and the spiral development.</p>

| Level | 6A Focus | Training Outcome  |
| Sec 1 | AWARE of Self, Others, SPF and NPCC | Knowing oneself  |
| Sec 2 | ACQUIRE skills and knowledge | Stepping out and interacting |
| Sec 3 | ACTUATE as leader | First taste of taking charge |
| Sec 4/5 |ASPIRE to serve| Stepping out to lead |
| Youth Leaders (CIs) | ACHIEVE competency in skills and knowledge | Leading others |
| Officers | AIM to nurture | Developing others |

Cadet Reflections

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">I joined NPCC since Sec 1 and I have had a very fun experience in the CCA. Being in NPCC taught me qualities such as perseverance, resilience, respect, integrity, responsibility, team work, care and trust. As a cadet leader, we have a lot more responsibilities such as planning for weekly training and sec 1 camp, all the while ensuring that our own drills and skills are up to standard.</p>

**- CPL (NPCC) MOHAMED AMZATH MOHAMED SALEEM (4R6)**

 
<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">As a cadet leader, one of the main challenges I encountered was the lack of communication within my squad. So I learned to communicate with my squadmates whenever I needed help. I also learned to take responsibility when leading a team and to keep a lookout for each other. </p>

**- SSGT (NPCC) SOH XIU YUN (4R5)**


<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">NPCC has instilled many core values in me and developed me into a better person. Though training can be arduous at times, I still find NPCC enjoyable because of the fond memories I hold with my squadmates thus far.</p>
