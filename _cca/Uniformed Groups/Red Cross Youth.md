<p style="text-align:justify">This year, cadets went on a learning journey to HSA Blood Bank to understand more about the blood donation process. Blood is needed to save lives in times of emergencies and to sustain the lives of those with medical conditions, like leukemia, thalassaemia and bleeding disorders, as well as patients who are undergoing major surgeries. Cadets learnt about the dire shortage of blood we face as every hour of the day, 15 units of blood are used in Singapore. 400 units of blood is required daily to meet the blood needs of patients in Singapore. One of the tasks cadets are required to complete on the learning journey is to learn about each station of the blood donation process and how to address queries of potential blood donors as well as dispel any myths about blood donation.</p>


<p style="text-align:justify">Cadets also enjoyed going on a combined UG hike to Mount Faber where they challenged their physical limits and enjoyed bonding as a unit as they hiked together. They enjoyed chatting with one another and enjoying the lush greenery hiking along the park connector. It was a truly refreshing and rejuvenating hike for all and cadets enjoyed themselves immensely. They also provided first aid to other unit members along the hike.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify">Our cadets also trained hard and entered the First Aid Championship 2023. It is an annual platform for Red Cross Youth members to hone and showcase their readiness for First Aid emergencies. Thus, FAC 2023 aims to increase preparedness level so that first aid can be effectively rendered in real-life situations. We aim to nurture care and humanity in our youths by engaging them in real-life simulations to reinforce the role that our youths play as first aiders in our community. Cadets are trained to apply the knowledge that cadets have learnt in the First Aid and Disaster management syllabus and have it assessed by judges with real-life experience. The theme for FAC 2023 is “Humanity in Our Hands” with the aim of improving the quality of First Aid provided, by focusing on the amount of care that our cadets render to casualties both during and after treatment, such that the casualties will feel at ease.</p>
