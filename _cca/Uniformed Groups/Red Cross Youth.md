As we bid farewell to our graduating cohort during the World Red Cross Day ceremony, we celebrated the successes and contributions of the seniors who took pains to plan an enriching curriculum  and fun activities for their juniors. It was also especially meaningful to see the graduating seniors welcome the new Sec 1 cadets by pinning enrolment badges on their new uniforms as they start on their Red Cross journey.

Despite the pandemic, our cadets looked forward to participate in meaningful projects and masterclasses. This year our lower secondary cadets participated in a VIA project called Project #AOK Campaign which is a social media campaign aimed at encouraging our cadets to display acts of kindness to others in trying times, such as COVID-19. They completed the acts of kindness through an activity game similar to Bingo.

Our Upper Secondary cadets also participated in a Dengue Awareness campaign which is a Digital Awareness Campaign aimed to spread dengue awareness and also allow cadets to understand the importance of dengue prevention in our community. The students had plenty of fun designing board games.

Even though the pandemic disrupted the physical masterclasses, our cadets still learnt a lot through the masterclasses conducted online. Through the Youth Ambassador Blood Programme, cadets learnt how to dispel the myths of blood donation and made a pitch to encourage their friends and family to donate blood to save lives as Singapore is currently facing a severe shortage of blood donors. Through the First Aid masterclasses, our cadets brushed up on their theoretical knowledge on how to provide basic first aid in times of an emergency.

We continue to look forward to another year of exciting activities where cadets pick up useful knowledge of first aid, blood donation advocacy, community service and disaster risk management. We hope our cadets live up to the Red Cross motto of serving humanity and saving lives as they grow to become humanitarian leaders of tomorrow.

*“I have learnt a lot over the years in Red CrossYouth, from life-saving skills to soft skills such as problem-solving, communication and leadership skills. These skills have aided me in being a more caring and confident leader. Having the role as Chairperson entrusted to me has pushed me out of my comfort zone to lead the unit. I am pleased that I chose Red Cross Youth CCA because it has helped me grow into the person I am today.”*
