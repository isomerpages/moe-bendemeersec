If your child/ward exhibits interest, potential and passion for Art or Music, he/she can apply for Art Elective Programme (AEP) or Music Elective Programme (MEP) in the following Centres from Secondary One:

* AEP: National Junior College
* MEP: Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) or Dunman High School

The online application is open from **3rd to 16th January 2023**.

Successful applicants will attend weekly lessons in the afternoon at the AEP/MEP Centre and are expected to commit to the programme for 4 years. Prior to application, interested students and their parents should work closely with us to ensure that your child/ward school timetable and commitments would allow him/her to participate fully in the AEP/MEP.&nbsp;

In view of the extended Art/Music curriculum, AEP/MEP students will not be offered Design and Technology (D&amp;T) and Food and Consumer Education (FCE) at the Lower Secondary level to ensure that their overall curriculum load is manageable.
