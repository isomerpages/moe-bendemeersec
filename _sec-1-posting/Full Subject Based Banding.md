Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) is part of MOE's ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.

With Full SBB, we are moving towards a secondary school education where students learn each subject at the level that best caters to their overall strengths, interests and learning needs. Under Full SBB, there will no longer be separate Express, N(A), and N(T) streams, and students will be in mixed form classes where they can interact with peers of different strengths and interests.


Under Full SBB, MOE will expand Subject-Based Banding (SBB) beyond the four PSLE subjects, to allow eligible students to offer Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2.

Other subjects such as Art, Design and Technology, Food and Consumer Education, Music will be offered as an accompanying set of Common Curriculum subjects at lower secondary.

Starting from the 2024 Secondary One cohort, Full SBB will be implemented in our secondary education system. Secondary One students in 120 secondary schools will benefit from the Full SBB experience, which provides greater customisation and flexibility for each studentâ€™s learning.
