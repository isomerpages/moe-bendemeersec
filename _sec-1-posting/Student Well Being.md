#### **School Counselling Service**

Our school counsellors help to provide a safe environment for students to share their challenges and work through their social, emotional, behavioural and mental health issues. They support students by helping them learn and use strategies to manage and cope with their emotions or situation and enables them to make choices for positive change and development.
<br>
Our school counsellors are available for you and we want to make your school experience as enriching as it can be. You may be feeling uncomfortable with certain issues or are not doing as well in school as according to your expectations. The counsellors will try to help you figure out what is going on. It is also a good idea to know about counselling and what school counsellors do even if you don't need any help right now. You are welcomed to walk into the counselling room to speak with the counsellor should you encounter difficult situations such as:
<br>
* Stress
* Academic /Exam Anxieties
* Grief and Loss
* Relationship issues with Peers
* Family Conflicts
* School Anxieties
* Bullying









#### **Special Educational Needs (SEN)**

Our school seeks to develop an inclusive community that promotes a culture of openness, understanding and mutual support for students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) to access a positive and holistic education experience, and attain greater independence. 

We provide a range of support to students with SEN include those with learning and behavioural needs (e.g. dyslexia, ADHD and autism spectrum), sensory needs like hearing loss and vision impairment, and physical and motor needs.  Some of these students are given access to assistive technology to support their learning. 

Parents of child with SEN may contact the school for pre-admission advisement and transition support for incoming students.
