We are now inviting current Primary Six students who have a keen interest in the following areas to join the school through the Direct School Admission (DSA-Sec) Exercise.</p>

#### LEARNING FOR LIFE PROGRAMME (LLP): DEVELOPING STUDENT LEADERSHIP THROUGH SERVICE LEARNING*

 **1. Our LLP Programme For Successful DSA Students**

<p style="text-align:justify">Bendemeer Secondary School is focused on developing student leadership through service learning. While still encapsulating the core objectives of National Education, such as nurturing students into active citizens with a sense of rootedness and responsibility to their community and fellow Singaporeans, the LLP will also provide students with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes, self-expression and strengthen their people skills.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Leadership Development team aims to develop student leaders who are active learners with vision, passion, resilience and integrity to succeed in the global environment and to serve our nation as active citizens. Hence, part of their training encompasses a student initiated and a self-directed service learning project. This will provide them with an opportunity to understand key issues in the community and use problem solving skills to solve real world issues. Working in teams, students will be encouraged to identify an area of concern in a community, explore possible challenges, establish the underlying problem and propose an action plan to solve the problem. Once the proposed solution has been implemented, students will also be required to reflect upon the process, the learning and impact they have made on the community.</p>

**2. LLP Admission Criteria** <br>
<p style="text-align:justify">In the selection of students, we are looking for students with one or more of the following attributes and experience:</p>

The objective of the ALP is to give our students an opportunity to communicate effectively while collaborating with their peers to engineer innovative solutions that address the healthcare needs of the elderly in Singapore.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Our Tier 1 programme provides the foundation for all our Sec 1 and Sec 2 students to explore integrated learning beyond the curriculum and a platform for them to contribute actively back to our society.
