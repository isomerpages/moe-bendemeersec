## **English Literature**

**Sec 1 DramaWorkz module**

Under the Sec 1E customised instructional programme, the students go through a series of lessons that exposes them to basic drama techniques like the use of voice, space awareness and expression. The students make use of their Literature drama texts, and create a short performance task based on these texts and the techniques they have learnt from their DramaWorkz module. The students put their collaborative skills to good use, and the process often sparks their creative juices to flow as they work together to produce an engaging performance.

**Sec 2 Story-telling module**

The Sec 2E students go through a five-week module that allows them to pick up essential story-telling skills. Now focusing much more on the individual’s use of voice, movement and gestures, this module allows students to bring short texts to life, using their own interpretations and the techniques they have learnt. Students have even brought these performances to the stage during assembly talks, wowing their peers with their display of confidence and creativity.

**National Schools Literature Festival (NSLF)**

The National Schools Literature Festival (NSLF) is the biggest literary festival for students in Singapore and has provided a powerful platform to develop students’ passion and love for literature. In 2019, we sent our biggest group yet, with four upper secondary Debate teams and a lower secondary Choral Reading team.
Being well prepared and well-rehearsed, all five teams put on great performances. Our debate teams put forth their arguments and convinced the judges with much fervour and passion. The most intense debate was the final debate of the day for Bendemeer, the Sec 4 Unseen Poetry debate. Done with their own competitions, the others had gathered round to watch the match play out. It was a nail-biting debate, with both sides putting forth convincing arguments. Then Krislyn Foo, the final speaker stepped up and stood resolute against her opponents. She placed her notes gently down, needing not to refer to them, as her hands conducted an imaginary orchestra to rebut against each and every inconsistency brought up. 

Here’s what Krislyn thought of the whole experience:

*“This NSLF competition was definitely an enriching and memorable experience. I have picked up many essential skills needed for Literature and more importantly, my love for literature has definitely deepened. After this festival, I have started to look forward to unraveling the hidden messages in unseen poems, enjoying literature lessons way more than I did in the past!”*

Meanwhile, the lower secondary choral reading team delivered the poem “Homework, I Love You”, by Kenn Nesbitt with such gusto that the judges were left nodding and laughing at the tongue-in-cheek performance. The competition was tough, and we stood against forty-two other schools. When our school’s name was announced at the prize giving ceremony, the team leaders Shafiqa and Sofia ran forward to the stage beaming with pride.

*“NSLF has been a joy and a delightful experience,” gushed Arielle Nur Shafiqa, a Secondary 2 student. “If I had the chance to do it again, I would in a heartbeat!”*

It was indeed a meaningful experience for the entire Bendemeer team, and the hard work put in was rewarded with a total of three trophies: Silver Medal for Choral Speaking, Winner for Sec 3 Set Text Debate and Winner for Sec 4 Unseen Poetry.
