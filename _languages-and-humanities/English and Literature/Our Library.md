Here are some useful links to navigate our school library.

The **Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC)** is the default search engine for books available in the Bendemeer library. Use this portal to search for specially curated reads by our librarian and available books to borrow.

OPAC: <a href="https://schoolibrary.moe.edu.sg/bendemeersec" target="_blank" >https://schoolibrary.moe.edu.sg/bendemeersec</a>


Alternatively, if you prefer to read digitally, **SORA** is the portal for you! Once you log in with your unique username and password, youâ€™ll be able to read e-books from our digital library. You can also borrow books from National Library Board (NLB) through SORA. Simply log into your NLB account.
