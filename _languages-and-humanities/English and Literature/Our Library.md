Here are some useful links to navigate our school library.

The Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) is the default search engine for books available in the Bendemeer library. Use this portal to search for specially curated reads by our librarian and available books to borrow.

OPAC: <a href="https://schoolibrary.moe.edu.sg/bendemeersec" target="_blank" >https://schoolibrary.moe.edu.sg/bendemeersec</a>


Alternatively, if you prefer to read digitally, SORA is the portal for you! Once you log in with your unique username and password, youâ€™ll be able to read e-books from our digital library. You can also borrow books from National Library Board (NLB) through SORA. Simply log into your NLB account.
