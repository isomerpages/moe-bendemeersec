<p><strong>War &amp; Diplomacy History Card Game</strong> is a strategy game
of survival and conquest developed in Bendemeer Secondary School. It aims
to simulate the experience of governments during the turbulent era of 1918-1945
in making political decisions pertaining to invasion, trade, diplomacy,
reparations, sanctions, propaganda and appeasement. The content of the
game is designed to be closely linked to the current Elective History syllabus.
Through this experience, students will also gain a better understanding
of Singapore as an important entrepôt of the world, bringing our National
Education messages to life.</p>
<p><strong>Briefing and Training Day (29th February 2024)</strong> 
<br>We hope that through this challenge, the intricate concepts learned in
history will come alive and students will develop their interest in history.
As this game is not available in the market, contestants are encouraged
to attend a training on <strong>29th February 2024</strong>.
<br><strong>Location</strong>: Bendemeer Secondary School Hall</p>
