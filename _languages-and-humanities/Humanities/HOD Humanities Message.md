<p style="text-align:justify">I believe that the study of Humanities is a cohesive collection of experiences, each providing its own unique contribution where students learn to make sense of the world around them. This helps to nurture knowledgeable and committed citizens with a global outlook and skills for the future.</p>

<br>
<br>
	
<p style="text-align:justify">In alignment to the Schoolsâ€™ Vision, Mission, Values and Motto, the department seeks to influence passionate learners and critical thinkers who will see the relevance of Humanities subjects in their everyday lives.</p>

<br>
<br>
	
<p style="text-align:justify">Through an inquiry-based pedagogical approach, my department equips our students to investigate national and global issues by adopting different perspectives and questioning the accuracy and relevancy of what they hear, read and see in their daily lives. It also teaches them to investigate and solve problems in the exploration of issues surrounding us. The acquisition of these lifelong skills will equip and prepare our students to handle complex challenges of the future.</p>

<br>
<br>
	
<p style="text-align:justify">The study of social studies seeks to help students understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the bigger world they live in. We hope that our students become informed, concerned and participative citizens that care about contributing responsibly to the society and the world they live in. Learning history enables students to understand and grapple with complex questions and dilemmas by examining how the past has shaped global, national, and local relationships between societies and people. Learning of Geography provides students with an opportunity to explore geographical questions. Students will be able to gain a global awareness and understanding of current geographical issues and challenges, and develop a concern and appreciation for the environment around them. Humanities subjects thus empowers students to develop critical thinking and communication skills as well as global perspectives for them to become confident people, active contributors, and concerned citizens.</p>

<br>
<br>
	
<p style="text-align:justify">I strongly believe that a Humanities education is a fertile ground for grooming critical thinkers who can comprehend our increasingly diverse and multidimensional world, and address a wide range of significant issues we face in society. They will be able to adopt a multitude of perspectives and expand their outlook to understand the full complexity and the various nuances of the world so that they can be a more balanced individual.
