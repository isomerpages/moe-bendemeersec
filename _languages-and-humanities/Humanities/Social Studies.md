## Social Studies

Our Social Studies curriculum consciously aims to go beyond the textbook to develop inquiring minds that will imbue our students with the relevant skills and values to be responsible citizens who actively contribute to the school and community. This is clearly evident in our signature Social Studies programme  - the Secondary 3 LLP, a collaboration between Humanities (Social Studies) and the CCE departments. 

The studentsâ€™ LLP projects are based on social issues discussed during their Social Studies lessons and/or on any current issues. During the lessons, students integrate LLP & SS and tap on inquiry based learning to combine learning and research with authentic and practical projects that enhance community life. Some of these projects involve our students reaching out to the elderly to increase their awareness of cyber scams; creating posters and games for students on the awareness of healthy living; recycling and environmental projects. 

We also take part during the Humanities Week, where we collaborate with other departments to take on social issues such as water conservation in Singapore where students can apply their knowledge and skills of various subjects.
