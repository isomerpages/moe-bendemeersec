## **Geography**

Our Geography curriculum aims to inculcate students with knowledge and skill sets that go beyond textbook learning; allowing them to appreciate the dynamism of the earth while maintaining awareness of the earthâ€™s fragility. Our signature Geography programme - Geography Investigation (GI) is catered to all levels. Students are taught to hone their inquiry skills which focuses on sparking curiosity, gathering of data, interpretation of information and proving their hypothesis. Students enjoy these experiential learning as it allows them to apply the knowledge learnt in class to real world situations. 

Learning journeys pertaining to their topics also provide students with valuable experience on collection of accurate data. For example, Secondary 4 students would be brought to Gardens By The Bay, where they would undertake several tasks. Students are to interview tourists and gather feedback on the tourist attraction. At the same time, students are able to apply their skills such as using a compass to attain directions around the venue. Furthermore, students apply their knowledge by gathering data such as pedestrian count and land use survey which allows them to make better informed conclusions of their hypothesis.

We also take part during the Humanities Week, where we collaborate with other departments to take on a societal issue such as water conservation in Singapore where students can apply their knowledge and skills across various subjects.
