## **History**

The History department aims to instill the thirst for knowledge on past events that have shaped our world. We believe in educating students with historical skills that equip them with critical awareness when making connections between past and present. Historical Investigation (HI) is an integral component of Lower Secondary History education and as such our team has designed both Secondary 1 and 2 HI in line with the MOE syllabus. To allow our students to appreciate Singaporeâ€™s rich history we tailored an entire programme that displayed the key components of inquiry learning. 

Secondary 1 students were given the opportunity to explore the neighbourhood of Jalan Besar where Bendemeer Secondary School resides. At the end of the inquiry process, students were to produce a time capsule for the future generations to better understand and appreciate Jalan Besar in the 1900s. Students had to come up with conclusions based on their research done about the different sectors of Jalan Besar. Students thoroughly enjoyed the process of inquiry as they were able to make connections between the past and present. Students also learnt to apply their inference skills through this historical investigation.

Our team also hosts the War &amp; Diplomacy Competition annually where schools across Singapore take part from 2012. Many teams have taken part to emerge as winners for the competition. 

We also take part during the Humanities Week, where we collaborate with other departments to take on a societal issue such as water conservation in Singapore where students can apply their knowledge and skills across various subjects.
