**Festive Celebrations**

**Pongal Festival and Deepavali Celebrations**

In Bendemeer, Festive Celebrations are amongst the highlights of the MT Department programme. The three units have always strived to create awareness and understanding of our respective festive celebrations through the annual foyer display, covering different aspects of the celebrations each year. 

Every year, the Tamil Language Unit organizes the Pongal Festival and Deepavali celebrations. The school foyer will be decorated with vibrant Rangoli designs and traditional decorations. Pongal delicacies were served for the school to savour traditional indian delights. Amidst the fanfare the celebrations also put across the values inculcated through traditional practices.

Parents also participate in Pongal and Deepavali preparations at school by contributing their service in decorating school and making Pongal delicacies.

**Twinning Programme in Chennai (India)** 

Every year, a group of Secondary 3 students would travel to Chennai to visit schools there and immerse themselves in the rich culture of India. As part of our twinning programme with Bala Vidya Mandir Senior Secondary School, our students were given the opportunity to attend the lessons conducted as well as interact with the students in the school. In addition, the students visited two other schools, Devi Academy Senior Secondary School and a village school. Besides experiencing education in Chennai, students also visited many cultural and historical places such as Chokhi Dhani and Mahabalipuram which is prescribed by UNESCO as a world heritage site. It was indeed an eye-opening and enriching experience for all the students. 

The school also played host to staff and students from Devi Academy Senior Secondary School and Bala Vidya Mandir Senior Secondary School. The Secondary 3 students were selected to be the buddies of the visiting students to give them an insight into the life of a Bendemeerian. It was also a good opportunity for our students to find out about the education system, culture and lifestyle in India. This experience has helped to boost the confidence of our students and has improved their cultural and global awareness.
