#### **Teaching and Learning of Chinese Language**

<p style="text-align:justify">The Chinese Language unit continued to create opportunities for students to acquire critical thinking skills using the 3C (Context, Content, Connection) 3R (Researching, Reasoning, Reflecting) PBL model which was used to guide teachers in designing effective PBL problems for students. Process writing was implemented in 2019. The incorporation of the process writing approach with self-directed learning and collaborative writing allowed students to familiarise themselves with essay writing structures and make use of descriptive techniques in their writing. With the use of thinking routines in SLS and online mindmapping tools, teachers were able to break down the learning process and provide scaffolding for students of various learning abilities to guide them in the lesson process. In 2021, students received their own personal learning devices, which increased the effectiveness of this ICT-integrated learning process. </p>

#### **Higher Chinese Language**

<p style="text-align:justify">Bendemeer Secondary offers an enriching and holistic learning experience through our Higher Chinese Language (HCL) syllabus. Apart from the teaching of listening, speaking, reading and writing skills, different learning experiences are introduced to students to appreciate the Chinese culture and heritage.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Secondary One HCL students attended cultural lessons over a period of three cycles. They were first introduced to the Chinese calligraphy where they wrote couplets and proudly displayed them around the school during Chinese New Year celebrations. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Students were introduced to the history and characteristics of Chinese painting to learn to appreciate the beauty of the Chinese culture. Students also learnt the art of paper cutting. They started off by cutting basic patterns before learning to cut the Chinese characters.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Through these cultural lessons, we hope that students will be able to appreciate the Chinese culture and cultivate their interest in learning the Chinese Language</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Every year, a group of Secondary 3 students would embark on a learning journey cum school immersion programme to Xiamen, China. The objectives of the trip are to extend students’ learning experiences beyond Singapore and to expose them to a different cultural environment. The trip also gives students an opportunity to broaden their perspectives and learn social and language skills in a real world context.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p style="text-align:justify">During the trip, students were attached to Shuangshi Middle School, where they experienced local school life in China with their buddies. New friendships and fond memories were created as they attended classes with their buddies. Students also visited places of interest such as the Tan Kah Kee Museum, Hulishan Fortress, South Putuo Temple and Nanjing Hakka Earth Building, developing a deeper understanding and appreciation of Chinese culture and historical and geographical features.</p>
