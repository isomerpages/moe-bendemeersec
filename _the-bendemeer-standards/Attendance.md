<h4><strong>A.	ATTENDANCE</strong></h4>
<p>Attendance in school is mandatory. To develop our students to their fullest
potential, the school takes a strong stance towards student attendance
and punctuality. Students must take ownership of their learning by being
present and punctual for school-related activities and tasks.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Any absenteeism for any school day, including Co-Curricular Activities
(CCAs), and/or school planned programmes must be accompanied by an official
medical certificate (MC) from a medical practitioner registered with the
Singapore Medical Association.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parent/Guardian’s letter is only accepted for three days of absence per
semester.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only a MC is allowed for student’s absence from any assessment (school-based
assessment or national examinations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MC or parent/guardian’s letter must be submitted within one day upon
return to school. The school reserves the right to request for any documentation
where required. Failing which, the student will obtain a zero mark.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any wilful absenteeism will be severely dealt with. Truancy is a serious
offence. Students who are absent without valid reasons will face serious
disciplinary consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are not allowed to leave the school before his/her last period
ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event that a student is unwell during school hours, the School’s
administrative personnel will inform the student’s parent or legal guardian
to take him/her to see a medical doctor or home from school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students should not travel overseas during the school days. Written permission
must be sought from the Principal should there be a valid reason to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
