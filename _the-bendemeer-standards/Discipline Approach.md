<p><strong>J.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DISCIPLINE APPROACH</strong>
</p>
<p>Students learn well when there is order and discipline. They also need
care, encouragement and space to learn from mistakes, reflect on them and
make improvements. Our discipline approach adopts an educative process
to guide students to develop self-management and responsible decision-making.
Disciplinary consequences help them to learn the consequences of their
inappropriate actions and poor choices, and take responsibility not to
repeat their mistakes.</p>
