<p style="text-align:justify">Bendemeer Secondary School Cross Country is the CCA for students who enjoy running, especially long distances to join.  In each training session, members undergo vigorous training to hone and stretch their skills, strengths, and resilience.  The team has also taken part in various track and field events in addition to cross country competitions, so every member is given a chance to represent our school to take part in at least one competition.  Such opportunities allow each member to put themselves to the test, and to expand their horizons, having to interact and compete with their peers from other school teams.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify">Over the years, several members of the team have made significant achievements, including winning awards and attaining personal goals.  These include Yong Hui Hui, Captain of the 2018-2019 team and Kok Jin En, Captain of the 2020-2021 team; both of whom never failed to be part of the top 10 runners in various cross country and track events in their respective active years.  Kumar Saran, who was the Vice-Captain of the 2018-2019 team, came in fourth in the B Division Boys 1500m during the 2019 National Track and Field Championships.  He also proceeded to compete with top athletes from other schools in the B Division Boys 2000m Steeple Chase at the Sports Hub.  Sadayan Haaron Ahmed has also managed to compete in the semi-final round for the C Division Boys 400m in the 2023 National Track and Field Championships.</p>


<p style="text-align:justify">Spurred on by such achievements, each team member continues relentlessly towards achieving their individual and team goals during training, as they strive for the gold.</p>
