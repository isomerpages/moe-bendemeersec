<p style="text-align:justify">Bendemeer Secondary Sepak Takraw as a CCA provides boys with a keen interest in the sport a platform to not only enhance their playing skills but to have a co-curricular activity that is both interesting and challenging. Over the years, the boys are expected to demonstrate camaraderie, team work and sportsmanship, especially when representing the school at competitions. As they experience sports at a competitive level, the school hopes to prepare them psychologically for future sporting endeavours as they move on to higher educational institutions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The CCA comprises Secondary 1 to Secondary 4 students who are enthusiastic and motivated to learn the skills of the sport. The students play the game at recreational and competitive level. They are trained, guided and supervised by 3 dedicated teachers and a coach.</p> 

<p style="text-align:justify">Bendemeer Sepak Takraw kicked start the year by recruiting new members from Secondary One through skill testing sessions during the orientation week. After several sessions of intensive trainings, we had our friendly matches between the ‘B’ and ‘C’ division boys to assess our players’ readiness and competitiveness.  These matches and trainings provide us with a great opportunity to build good and strong friendship with others. It also gives the new members a good platform for team bonding.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Trainings are conducted two times a week. They are held on Mondays and Wednesdays.  During training, the team not only focuses on the athletic aspects critical to the sport but also on character bulding and leadership. School values such as resilience, respect and integrity are instilled in every player throughout the training sessions. Very often, the boys looked forward to these trainings and turned up even earlier before training started. Trainings may be exhausting and gruelling but the boys enjoyed themselves and persevered throughout the training sessions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The teachers and coaches have built a very strong rapport with these boys and often motivated and encouraged them not only in terms of having good sportsmanship but also on character-building.</p>

Without these skills, we will not be able to play well during the competitive matches . My advice to anybody reading this, never give up or lose hope . Just enjoy your CCA and even if you lose, just train harder next time.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">The training for Sepak Takraw this year was hard and tiring but it was also rewarding as we were able to hone our basic skills. Even though occasionally I was a reserve player during the national school games competitions, I can see that my team mates used the skills they have learnt from training, resulting in some wins for our team.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; font-style:italic">This is my first time playing Sepak Takraw as a CCA. It was a great experience as I have learnt a lot from my coach and team mates. Although the training was tiring, it was also fun. We played matches against our own team mates. In this way, we practised how to upgrade our skills and be ready for the coming competitions.</p>
