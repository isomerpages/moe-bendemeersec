<h4><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>We believe that every child is unique and has his/her own passion, talents
and aspiration. To prepare them to be future ready in this fast-paced and
dynamic environment, the department seek to nurture them to be a critical,
adaptive and inventive thinkers who is inspired by science, inquire like
scientists and innovate using science.</p>
<h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The Science Department customise and enhance the learning experiences
of each child through a well-designed science curriculum to:</p>
<p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encourage students to apply the knowledge,
skill sets and competencies gained in Science to make responsible and well-informed
decision in their daily lives to solve problems, and contribute to the
society, to improve self and others.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; provide all students with a good foundation
in Science learning and excite them in the pursue of STEAM related work.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inculcate desire Values and attitudes of
life such as Resilience, Integrity, Curiosity, inquisitive and Responsibility
through role-modelling and the practices of thinking and doing of a Scientist.</p>
<p>In the teaching and learning of Science, various approaches that deepen
application of conceptual understanding in new context and the strengthening
of science related skills and competencies were harnessed.</p>
<p>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Inquiry based learning</p>
