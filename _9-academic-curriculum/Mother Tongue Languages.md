<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>The department aims to cultivate a love for Mother Tongue languages (Chinese,
Malay, and Tamil) by fostering lifelong learning and encouraging practical
application of language skills beyond the classroom environment. Through
diverse programmes, including ICT-integrated lessons and cultural exposure,
all Mother Tongue units provide opportunities for students to showcase
their talents, enhance academic learning, and develop language skills.
This comprehensive approach enables students to attain a commendable level
of proficiency and competency in their Mother Tongue, empowering them to
excel academically, appreciate their cultural heritage, and gain a broader
global perspective. Ultimately, this enriches their understanding of the
world around them and prepares them to become well-rounded individuals
who can contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The department is committed to providing a comprehensive and engaging
learning experience across Chinese, Malay, and Tamil languages. Whilst
focusing on essential language skills, each unit designs diverse programmes
that immerse students in the rich cultural heritage of their respective
languages. The Chinese Language unit emphasises cultural experiences, the
Malay unit promotes active learning and proficiency through exposure to
ethnic traditions, and the Tamil unit employs hands-on learning, differentiated
experiences, and shared activities like the reading programme and theatre
experience. All units extend learning beyond the classroom through language
camps, competitions, and cultural events, fostering collaboration, peer
learning, and a deeper appreciation for linguistic and cultural diversity.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme is an initiative by the Committee
to Promote Chinese Language Learning, which aims to expose students to
Chinese language-related cultural performances by local and foreign performing
arts groups. It seeks to cultivate an appreciation of the performing arts,
particularly local traditions, and deepen students' understanding of Singapore's
cultural diversity.</p>

<p>Our Secondary 1 Higher Chinese and Secondary 2 students had the opportunity
to watch a drama performance titled "周处除三害" and learnt important values
such as responsibility, perseverance and self-awareness in the process.
This unique experience was well-received by the students as they enjoyed
interacting with the casts and fostered a greater appreciation for the
performing arts.</p>

<p>Bendemeer Secondary offers an enriching and holistic learning experience

<p>The Secondary One HCL students had Chinese calligraphy lessons where they
learned how to write Chinese couplets and proudly displayed them around
the school during the Chinese New Year celebrations. Students also learned
the art of Chinese painting and paper cutting. Through these cultural lessons,
students were able to show appreciation for Chinese culture and deepen
