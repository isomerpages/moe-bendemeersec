<h4><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>The department aims to cultivate a love for Mother Tongue languages (Chinese,
Malay, and Tamil) by fostering lifelong learning and encouraging practical
application of language skills beyond the classroom environment. Through
diverse programmes, including ICT-integrated lessons and cultural exposure,
all Mother Tongue units provide opportunities for students to showcase
their talents, enhance academic learning, and develop language skills.
This comprehensive approach enables students to attain a commendable level
of proficiency and competency in their Mother Tongue, empowering them to
excel academically, appreciate their cultural heritage, and gain a broader
global perspective. Ultimately, this enriches their understanding of the
world around them and prepares them to become well-rounded individuals
who can contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
<h4><strong>Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The department is committed to providing a comprehensive and engaging
learning experience across Chinese, Malay, and Tamil languages. Whilst
focusing on essential language skills, each unit designs diverse programmes
that immerse students in the rich cultural heritage of their respective
languages. The Chinese Language unit emphasises cultural experiences, the
Malay unit promotes active learning and proficiency through exposure to
ethnic traditions, and the Tamil unit employs hands-on learning, differentiated
experiences, and shared activities like the reading programme and theatre
experience. All units extend learning beyond the classroom through language
camps, competitions, and cultural events, fostering collaboration, peer
learning, and a deeper appreciation for linguistic and cultural diversity.</p>

cultural diversity.</p>

<p>Our Secondary 1 Higher Chinese and Secondary 2 students had the opportunity
to watch a drama performance titled "周处除三害" and learnt important values
such as responsibility, perseverance and self-awareness in the process.
This unique experience was well-received by the students as they enjoyed
interacting with the casts and fostered a greater appreciation for the
performing arts.</p>
