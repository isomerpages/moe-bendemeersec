<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>The elective subjects aim to develop students in three key areas. First,
they foster holistic development by exposing students to a variety of disciplines,
such as art, design, business, and music, which builds creativity, critical
thinking, and practical skills. Second, they encourage active learning,
where students take responsibility for their own growth, developing curiosity,
adaptability, and the skills needed for continuous personal and professional
development. Finally, these subjects promote civic responsibility, teaching
students to work in teams, show empathy, and contribute positively to society
as responsible and engaged citizens.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The department aims to create an engaging learning environment that helps
students succeed both personally and academically. By using diverse teaching
methods like Differentiated Instruction, Inquiry-Based Learning, and Collaborative
Learning, they address each student's unique needs. Incorporating Authentic
Learning, Technology-Based Lessons, Activity-Based Lessons, and Problem-Based
Learning connects students with real-world challenges, boosting their critical
thinking and problem-solving skills. This combination of approaches ensures
students are well-prepared for the demands of a changing world.</p>
