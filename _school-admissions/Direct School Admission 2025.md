<p><strong><u>Football CCA</u></strong>
</p>
<p>We are proud to be one of ten secondary schools identified as a <strong>School Football Academy (SFA)</strong> since
end 2022 under the <strong>Unleash the Roar! (UTR</strong>) national project
led jointly by <strong>Ministry of Education (MOE),</strong>  <strong>SportSG and Football Association of Singapore (FAS)</strong>.
In 2025, the CCA started a Girls Football team in preparation for participation
in the Nationals School Games (NSG) in 2026. Our Boys teams also did well
in NSG this year, with both the B and C Division teams playing in League
1 amongst the top 16 teams in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong><u>Tchoukball CCA</u></strong>
</p>
<p>While Tchoukball is relatively new in Singapore, it is an established
sport in the school with a strong legacy. We are known to have nurtured
many national players, coaches and officials in the sport. Our own alumnus
is also serving as the President of the <strong>Tchoukball Association of Singapore (TBAS)</strong>.
In the ActiveSG cup this year, our B division boys emerged second runners
up while our B division girls emerged among the Top 6 teams in the competition.</p>
<p><strong><u>Concert Band CCA</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Led by one of our school alumni, Conductor Mr Joseph Teo, the Bendemeer
Concert Band has taken part in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
and achieved commendable results. The Concert Band also performed in school
concerts and public performances such as the Limelight Series Concert organised
by Esplanade. Most recently, they achieved the Certificate of Distinction
in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2025.</p>
<p><strong><u>Modern Dance CCA</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Modern Dance CCA in Bendemeer Secondary School is a platform not only
for individuals to express emotions and ideas through movement but also
promotes social interaction and teamwork though collaboration among its
members. In the 2023 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, the CCA
did the school proud by achieving the Certificate of Distinction. &nbsp;In
the 2025 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, the CCA narrowly missed
out on the Certificate of Distinction and achieved the Certificate of Accomplishment.</p>
<p><strong><u>Choir CCA</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In Bendemeer Secondary School, the Choir CCA aspires for excellence through
a robust training program aimed at improving students’ vocal technique,
breathe control and the ability to blend as one voice. Our teachers and
conductor help to bring out the best in our choir members, allowing them
to grow as individuals and as a team. The CCA did the school proud by achieving
the Certificate of Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
in 2025.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><u>Character and CCA Excellence</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Our focus in building both character and CCA excellence have resulted
in nurturing outstanding results in various competitions throughout the
academic year. &nbsp;More importantly, we build character, strengthen our
strengths and nurture a mindset of excellence.</p>
