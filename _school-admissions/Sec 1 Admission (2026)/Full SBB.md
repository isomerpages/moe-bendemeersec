<p>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) is part of MOE's ongoing efforts
to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to
the different strengths and interests of our students.</p>

<p>With Full SBB, we are moving towards a secondary school education where
students learn each subject at the level that best caters to their overall
strengths, interests and learning needs. Under Full SBB, there will no
longer be separate Express, N(A), and N(T) streams, and students will be
in mixed form classes where they can interact with peers of different strengths
and interests.</p>
<p>Subjects such as Art, Design and Technology, Food and Consumer Education,
Music will be offered as an accompanying set of Common Curriculum subjects
at lower secondary.</p>
<p>Starting from the 2024 Secondary 1 cohort, Full SBB will be implemented
in our secondary education system. We are excited to share we had piloted
Full SBB and will continue to provide greater customisation and flexibilty
for all our students' learning.</p>
