<p>Our student well-being is our top priority. We provide the following services
to ensure our students are well-supported.</p>
<h4><strong>School Counselling Service</strong></h4>
<p>Our school counsellors provide a safe environment for students to share
their social, emotional, behavioural and mental health concerns. They support
students by helping them learn and use strategies to manage and cope with
their emotions, and empower them to make choices for positive change and
development.</p>
<p>All students are welcomed to speak with our teachers and school counsellors.</p>
<h4><strong>Support for Students with Special Educational Needs (SEN)</strong></h4>
<p>We promote an inclusive community of understanding and mutual support
for students with SEN to access a positive and holistic education experience,
and attain greater independence.</p>
<p>We provide a range of support for students with with learning and behavioural
needs (e.g. dyslexia, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Autism
Spectrum Disorder), sensory needs (e.g. hearing loss and vision impairment),
and physical and motor needs, including access to assistive technology
to support their learning.</p>

<p>Parents/Guardians who would like to seek counselling services or support
for their child/ward with special needs can contact the school for pre-admission
advisement and transition.</p>
