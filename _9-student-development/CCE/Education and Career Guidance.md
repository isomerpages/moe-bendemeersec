<p>Our school believes that every child can learn and in line with our motto
“From each his best,” we want every child to reach his fullest potential
in life. We feel that the definition of success needs to be broadened,
and in that sense, every child can succeed.</p>
<p>With an ever-changing global landscape and multiple advances in technologies,
our youths will need different attributes to succeed in the future. They
have to be competent in the 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies which are
necessary for this globalized world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Education and Career Guidance (ECG) helps students develop a sense of
purpose in life. By nurturing self-awareness and self-directedness for
lifelong learning, ECG helps students develop a growth mindset, adaptability
and a resilient attitude to embrace future opportunities and appreciate
the value of all occupations.</p>
<p>In Bendemeer, We adopt a thematic approach to ECG to help them discover
the 3 big questions of “Who am I”, “Where am I going” and “How do I get
there?” with skills, values and competencies spiraling upwards.</p>

<p>In all ECG programmes, we place a lot of emphasis on Students’ Voice and
Choice. We let students choose the learning journeys or talks they were
interested to explore.</p>
<p>From Sec 2 to Sec 4, we curate our own ECG lessons to supplement the CCE
curriculum.</p>
<p>In Sec 1, we focus on transition to secondary school and included coping
skills in our CCE curriculum.</p>
<p>In Sec 2, we have our signature Career Exploration programme where we
invite speakers from various industries to talk to our students on different
job opportunities in different industry sectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Sec 3, as part of our Career Development Programme, we bring students
out for Learning Journeys to various industries to widen their perspectives
and development their areas of curiosity as they tour and have some hands
on activities.</p>
<p>In Sec 4/5, in order to inculcate the joy of learning and to give our
students a competitive edge to qualify for the more competitive courses,
our school prepares our students well for EAE and DSA. We guide students
in making informed choices and guide them in their write ups, portfolios
and interviews.</p>
