<h4><strong>School Counselling Service</strong></h4>
<p>Our school counsellors provide a safe environment for students to share
their social, emotional, behavioural and mental health concerns. They support
students by helping them learn and use strategies to manage and cope with
their emotions, and empower them to make choices for positive change and
development.</p>
<p>All students are welcomed to speak with our teachers and school counsellors.</p>
