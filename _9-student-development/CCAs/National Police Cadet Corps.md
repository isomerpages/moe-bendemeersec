<h4><strong>Our National Police Cadet Corps CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) is a uniformed group co-curricular
activity (CCA) closely aligned with the Singapore Police Force (SPF). Its
primary objective is to cultivate responsible citizens with strong values,
leadership qualities, and a sense of civic duty.</p>
<p>NPCC strives to instill core values such as discipline, integrity, and
responsibility in its cadets. By collaborating with the SPF, cadets gain
valuable insights into Singapore's justice system and law enforcement practices.
The program offers numerous opportunities for leadership development, including
organizing camps, drills, and community projects. Physical fitness and
mental toughness are honed through drills, physical training, and outdoor
activities. Additionally, NPCC actively engages cadets in crime prevention
outreach and community service projects, fostering a sense of social responsibility.</p>
