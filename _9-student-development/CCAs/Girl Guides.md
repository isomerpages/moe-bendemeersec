<h4><strong>Our CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Bendemeer 1st Coy Girl Guides aims to empower girls to become confident,
courageous, and compassionate leaders. The program focuses on personal
and social development, home skills, outdoor activities, community service,
and international understanding. Through these experiences, girls develop
essential life skills such as leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving.
They also learn to care for others, protect the environment, and address
global issues like cyber safety and anti-bullying. By joining the World
Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, Bendemeer Guides have opportunities
to connect with girls worldwide and make a positive impact on their communities.</p>
