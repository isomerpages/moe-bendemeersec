<h4><strong>Student Leadership</strong></h4>
<p>In Bendemeer, we believe that every student can be developed as a leader.
As such, every student should be developed as leader. Hence, to ensure
that all Bendemeerians have a baseline understanding of leadership and
be equipped with leadership competencies and dispositions we are intentional
in providing a differentiated development for our students.</p>
<p>The Student Leadership Framework adopts a progressive leadership dimension
approach. Students sharpen their skills set as they progress from self-leadership
to team leadership, and to thought leadership. <em>Self-leadership</em> sets
the foundation for developing leadership potential by focusing on self-mastery
and personal effectiveness. <em>Team leadership</em> focuses on managing
team dynamics as they lead their peers while <em>thought leadership</em> focuses
on being effective influencers to create value to their area of influence.</p>
<p><strong>Student Leadership Framework</strong>
<br>The Student Leaders comprises Class Chairpersons, Peer Support Leaders,
Student Councillors and CCA Leaders. In their respective roles, they applied
their leadership skills in the various platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>The Leaders Council (LEADS)</strong></h4>
<p>The Leaders Council (LEADS) consists of the top tier student leaders of
the 4 leadership groups. In line with our student leadersâ€™ motto to Lead
and Serve, LEADS will Lead, Elevate, Adapt, Direct and Serve the school
and community. LEADS aims to elevate each other to new heights as they
discuss and coordinate activities, share ideas, and work together to enhance
the student experience. They will apply their adaptive thinking, communication
and collaboration skills to provide input for the overall running of the
school with regards to school improvement. They represent the voice of
the student body through Student Forum sessions. LEADS serve as directional
leaders of the student leadership group. They come together to think strategically
and set direction. Together, LEADS will serve the school and the community
through various inter-school platforms.</p>
