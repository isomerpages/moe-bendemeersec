<h4><strong>Our Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
<p>Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) seeks to equip students with critical
thinking, leadership, and problem-solving skills to address sustainability
challenges through STEM knowledge and the design thinking process. Students
develop environmental literacy, adopt sustainable practices, and engage
in community advocacy, preparing them to lead and inspire broader sustainability
efforts.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach</strong></h4>
<p>The STEM-Sustainable Living programme at Bendemeer Secondary School offers
a comprehensive approach to environmental education and problem-solving.
It integrates design thinking with sustainability concepts, guiding students
from understanding needs to testing solutions for real-world environmental
issues. Students develop environmental literacy, leadership, and teamwork
skills through community engagement and sustainability projects. The ALP
Eco Stewards take on advanced roles, managing national-level projects and
advocating for sustainability, while fostering global awareness and cultural
sensitivity. This holistic approach prepares students to be responsible
citizens capable of addressing complex sustainability challenges.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Signature Programmes and Activities</strong></h4>
<p>Bendemeer Secondary's ALP programme offers a two-year sustainability curriculum
for all students. Secondary One focuses on food, water, and land sustainability,
engaging students in sustainable practices, design thinking projects, and
waste reduction campaigns. Secondary Two shifts to energy sustainability,
with students analysing carbon footprints, conducting life-cycle assessments,
and developing energy-efficient systems using Microbit technology. The
programme culminates in campaigns and field trips, providing practical
experience in environmental stewardship and fostering a deep understanding
of sustainability issues.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Talent Development Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The ALP Eco Stewards program integrates STEM through scientific inquiry
and engineering skills to investigate environmental issues and design sustainable
systems. It emphasizes leadership in managing national sustainability projects,
advocating for eco-friendly policies, and leading campaigns. The program
also fosters cultural competence by respecting diverse practices and applying
interdisciplinary knowledge to address complex global sustainability challenges.</p>
