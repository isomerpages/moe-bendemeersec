<p>Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are becoming increasingly
pervasive in our world. While creating instant connectivity and access
to vast repositories of information, knowledge, and opinions, the open
nature of the Internet can expose our students to undesirable content and
influences.
<br>
<br>Cyber Wellness in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) focuses on
the well-being of our students as they navigate cyberspace. Our curriculum
aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to harness the power
of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace
and be safe and responsible users of ICT.</p>
<p>The 3 Cyber Wellness Key Messages</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle
between offline and online activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online
presence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be responsible for personal well-being in the cyberspace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At Bendemeer, Cyber Wellness education is integrated into CCE lessons,
Student Development Experiences, school initiatives, and other subject
lessons. We train Peer Support Leaders as Cyber Wellness Ambassadors to
promote positive peer influence. During Cyber Wellness week, these ambassadors
conduct lessons for classmates, raising awareness about creating a safer,
more positive online environment.
