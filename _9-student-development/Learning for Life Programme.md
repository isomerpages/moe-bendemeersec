<p>In Bendemeer, our VIA is embedded in our LLP.</p>
<p>In Tier 1, we adopt a thematic, spiral approach to our VIA, with skills,
competencies, values, and subject integration spiralling upwards as students
move from Sec 1 to Sec 4/5.</p>
<p>Bendemeer Secondary's Values in Action (VIA) programme offers a progressive,
four-year approach to community engagement and social responsibility. In
Secondary 1, students focus on "Love Our School," participating in a gardening
project that integrates science learning and culinary skills. Secondary
2 expands to "Love our Community," with students creating activities for
the elderly at local nursing homes. In Secondary 3, the focus shifts to
national and global issues, exploring themes like "Keeping SG Safe" and
"Healthy Living," addressing topics such as scam awareness, road safety,
and balanced diets. The programme culminates in Secondary 4/5 with "Love
Our Environment," where students research resource conservation and create
awareness campaigns for Earth Day, collaborating with the Humanities Department.
Throughout the programme, students engage in various community projects,
including working with primary school children, reinforcing the importance
of lifelong learning and school values as they prepare for their next educational
journey.</p>
<p>Tier 2 LLP involves our student leaders who work with CARE Singapore to
engage young children at Morning Star Community Services. Our student leaders
plan activities for the children and engage them during the sessions.</p>
