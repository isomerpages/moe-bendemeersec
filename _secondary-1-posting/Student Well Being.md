Our student well-being is our top priority.  We provide the following services to ensure our students are well-supported.  

#### **School Counselling Service**

Our school counsellors provide a safe environment for students to share their social, emotional, behavioural and mental health concerns. They support students by helping them learn and use strategies to manage and cope with their emotions or situation and enable them to make choices for positive change and development.

All students are welcomed to speak with our teachers and school counsellors should they need someone to speak with.  



#### **Support for Students with Special Educational Needs(SEN)**

We seek to promote an inclusive community of understanding and mutual support for students with SEN to access a positive and holistic education experience, and attain greater independence. 

We provide a range of support for students with with learning and behavioural needs (e.g. dyslexia, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and autism spectrum), sensory needs like hearing loss and vision impairment, and physical and motor needs, including access to assistive technology to support their learning. 

Parents/Guardians who would like to seek counselling services or support for their child/ward with special needs can contact the school for pre-admission advisement and transition
