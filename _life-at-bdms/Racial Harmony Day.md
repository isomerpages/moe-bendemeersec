The Racial Harmony Day started with a meaningful sharing on the importance of maintain harmony among the various races living in Singapore and the significance of celebrating racial harmony. The main message that was reinforced was that racial
harmony should never be taken for granted and everyone has a part to play in maintaining the peace and harmony of our nation.

Our enthusiastic school leaders, teachers and graduating students all adorned in
vibrant ethnic costumes on this special occasion.  Not to mention, students and teachers had lots of fun posing for photographs in their colourful ethnic wear.
