In Bendemeer Secondary, we believe that every student can shine and achieve his or her potential, anchored on our strong mission to build character, nurture learners and serve the community. The collective efforts of our teachers and students have borne fruits of labour which have made us distinctive and sustained the Bendemeer Heartbeat.

We have continued to achieve success in many domains and we have given students countless opportunities to grow in their respective areas of strength. This is firmly rooted in our belief that our students’ interests would ultimately drive their passion in their chosen field later in life. Our school’s two distinctive programmes, the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and Learning for Life Programme (LLP), strive to develop 21st century competencies, skills and mindsets in our students, broadening their learning and allowing them to pursue their interests and passion. This belief has also provided broad guidance to our school’s Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programme, which has prepared our graduating students well in their Early Admission Exercise (EAE) application. The fact that a significant proportion of our graduating students have been successful in securing a place in Polytechnic or ITE even before sitting for their national examination bears testament to our students capitalising on their interests and passion to pursue their post-secondary education.

On the curricular front, we have continued to deliver value-added results. Our students have maintained a high level of progression to post-secondary education institutions. A large percentage of our Sec 4 Express and Sec 5 Normal (Academic) students have gained entry to Polytechnic or Junior College. Likewise, our Sec 4 Normal (Academic) and Sec 4 Normal (Technical) students have achieved a high level of GCE N-level passes last year.

On the co-curricular front, we have continued to excel in the uniformed groups, sports and performing arts. Our uniformed groups have maintained high levels of achievement through hard work and resilience. Our Choir and Dance students wowed audiences during the Chingay Festival in February 2018, while our Concert Band was invited for the second time to perform for the public and the school community at the prestigious Limelight Concert at Esplanade – Theatre by the Bay. Moreover, our sports CCAs continue to provide avenues for our students to develop their passion and hone their skills.

The greatest strength of the school is our team of caring, committed and dedicated teachers. With a shared philosophy that “all students are unique individuals with talents”, the staff continue to guide our students to discover their strengths and achieve to the best of their potential. This established culture of care in the school endears students to their teachers, and spurs them to live by our school motto “From Each His Best”.

We aspire to continue to work hand-in-hand with our community partners to provide additional learning platforms and opportunities to develop our students’ 21st century competencies. Through the invaluable partnerships cultivated over the years with the School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group, institutes of higher learning, People’s Association grassroots organisations, Kolam Ayer Community Club, Central Singapore CDC, SINDA and the industry partners, we are well-placed to meet the challenges ahead of us. Together with our community partners, Bendemeer Secondary School will continue to work towards nurturing students who are future-ready and rooted in values – Bendemeerians who will be Active Learners, Responsible Citizens.
