<b><u>The Bendemeerian Code</u></b>

As a true Bendemeerian,
I am proud of my school, my uniform and personal appearance,
I obey the school authority,
I am polite in my speech and manners,
I am self-disciplined, honest and hardworking, 
I lead an active and healthy lifestyle and
I will always live by my school motto “**FROM EACH HIS BEST**”.
