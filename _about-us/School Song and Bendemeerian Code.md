The Bendemeerian Code
As true Bendemeerians, we are
A community of Critical Thinkers, Courageous Leaders, and Caring Contributors.
We are anchored in values. We dare to aspire,
Motivate one another, and strengthen our strengths,
To lead and serve with purpose.
We lead with courage, integrity and resilience.
We think critically and embrace change with adaptability.
We respect ourselves and others, contributing to a positive and inclusive community.
We strive for excellence in all our pursuits.                             
Together, we live out our school motto -
From Each His Best. To Lead and Serve.
