This year, we celebrated the achievements and staff and students during our 46th Speech Day and Prize Presentation on 21st April 2023.

The CCA groups prepared and put up performance on stage for the audience.  

We also had an unveiling of our school's official social media platforms on <a target="\_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BendemeerSecondaryOfficial?mibextid=LQQJ4d">Facebook</a> and <a target="\_blank" href="https://instagram.com/bendemeer_secondary_official?igshid=YjNmNGQ3MDY=">Instagram</a>.
