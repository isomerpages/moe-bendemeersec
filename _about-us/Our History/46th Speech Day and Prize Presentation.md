This year, we celebrated the achievements and staff and students during our 46th Speech Day and Prize Presentation on 21st April 2023.

The CCA groups prepared and put up performance on stage for the audience.  

We also had an unveiling of our school's official social media platforms on Facebook and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/bendemeer_secondary_official?igshid=YjNmNGQ3MDY=).

The prize presentation for students who achieved academic excellence in their subjects was held during our school morning assembly.  You may click on the links below to view a recording of the presentation.
