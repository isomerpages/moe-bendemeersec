## 40th Anniversary Celebrations and Speech Day

2017 marked our school’s 40th anniversary. As part of our 40th Anniversary Celebrations, the School Heritage Gallery was officially declared open by Mr Chiang Heng Liang, our School Advisory Committee chairman. In collaboration with our community partners, the school staff and students engaged in our ‘40 Acts of Kindness’ programme. We also had a Homecoming Dinner in conjunction with our 40th Speech Day.

The School Heritage Gallery was launched for Bendemerians to better appreciate our rich history. The Heritage Gallery serves to inculcate a sense of pride, belonging and connectivity within the Bendemeer family and appreciate Bendemeerians’ involvement and contributions in the community.

In keeping with Bendeemer’s long history of community involvement, we chose to mark the start of our celebrations with 40 Acts of Kindness. This involved our graduating cohort, staff, parents and alumni, adopting units in the surrounding neighborhood. We spent the day sprucing up these homes to show our appreciation to our community.
