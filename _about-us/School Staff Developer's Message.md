In Bendemeer, we believe that People are Key and that the Desired Outcomes of Education can only be achieved when the school is supported by staff who are anchored on values and equipped with pedagogical and professional competence. Thus a school culture that inspires trust and practices empowerment inspires teachers to be engaged and to strive for excellence which in turn will have a positive impact on student achievement and administrative excellence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
The continual professional growth of our teachers is crucial to the quality of teaching and student learning. As professionals, we understand the importance of continuously honing our craft and role modeling life-long learning. We want to enhance our competencies and stay relevant with changing times so as to better prepare our students for a world beyond their classrooms in this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous environment. As aptly put across by Dylan Williams -“If we create a culture where every teacher believes they need to improve, not because they are not good enough, but because they can be even better, there is no limit to what we can achieve.”</p>

Believing that staff well­being is also essential for a positive school culture, the school has put in place since 2012, a staff school based learning plan (SLP) based on the Physiological, Intellectual, Emotional and Social (PIES) approach to provide a more balanced and holistic approach to staff learning and development (L&D). Learning foci continues to be kept current via annual learning areas and planning of core L&D programmes and courses based on the school defined PIES dimensions. Teacher and leadership outcomes in the MOE Teacher Growth Model 3.0 and Leader Growth Model are also incorporated into the SLP. A concerted effort is also made to incorporate health enhancement, emotional well­being and work needs into the content of these sessions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">
By taking care of our staff “PIES”, we hope to empower our staff to continue to strive for quality education and administrative excellence for our learners.</p>
