Critical Thinker

<p style="text-align:justify">
As critical thinkers, students will:  
Develop the ability to analyse information, identify patterns, and solve complex problems creatively and logically.  
Engage in reflective and adaptive thinking, learning from experience and applying learnt knowledge and skills strategically and with flexibility in evolving contexts.&nbsp;  
Strengthen their critical thinking mindset, making informed decisions anchored on sound reasoning, evidence and values.  
Communicate their ideas clearly and effectively, demonstrating empathy and understanding of different perspectives.**

<b>We believe that every student can shine.</b> Every child has a talent. The staff focuses on helping students realise their own talents and abilities. By doing so, the students would be empowered to see possibilities in all circumstances. We believe that with empowered minds, our students would be inspired to be positive contributors to society.
