**We are a school that ignites a passion for learning.** The staff and students are encouraged to be creative and actively engaged in seeking solutions for the improvement of the community and country. We envision our graduates as confident youths who are equipped with skills and perspectives that make them relevant for their generation

**We believe that every student can shine.** Every child has a talent. The staff focuses on helping students realise their own talents and abilities. By doing so, the students would be empowered to see possibilities in all circumstances. We believe that with empowered minds, our students would be inspired to be positive contributors to society.
