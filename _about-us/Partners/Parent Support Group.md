<h4><strong>Parent Support Group (PSG)</strong></h4>
<p>The Parent Support Group (PSG) plays an integral role in strengthening
school-home partnership where parents collaborate with the school, share
ideas, and contribute to the overall development and growth of our children/ward.
We actively partner school in various activities whether through volunteering
or organising the school's initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>What We Do</strong>
</p>
<p>We are committed to supporting the holistic growth and development of
our children/ward through the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement of Parents: </strong>These engagement sessions provide
valuable insights into parenting, managing and supporting youth development
at different juncture of their secondary years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supporting School Events and Programmes: </strong>Our PSG members
volunteer their time and resources to ensure the success of these events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building a Strong Parent Community: </strong>We provide opportunities
for parents to network, share experiences, and form lasting friendships.
We believe that when parents are connected and engaged, it enhances the
school environment for everyone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
