<p style="text-align:justify">Parents lay the foundation of moral values for students and the development of character and citizenship in our students is greatly influenced by what happens in school and at home.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Hence, there must be active partnerships between school and home so that what is taught and learnt in school is reinforced at home. The learning of values, skills and competencies will be more effective and enriching for our students if there is alignment between what is taught in school and what is practised at home.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">At Bendemeer Secondary School, we believe in forging a partnership with parents in order to raise a well-adjusted and resilient child. By participating in school events and activities organised by PSG, you will find that your participation and contributions extend beyond developing your child holistically. You may also impact other students in this crucial developmental life stage and the experience is truly a rewarding one.</p>

Some of our key activities are:

* Breakfast with parents
* Parenting talks
* Coffee Talks with parents
* Bonding activities
