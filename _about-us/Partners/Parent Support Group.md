<h4><strong>Parent Support Group (PSG)</strong></h4>
<p>The Parent Support Group (PSG) plays an integral role in strengthening
school-home partnership where parents collaborate with the school, share
ideas, and contribute to the overall development and growth of our children/ward.
We actively partner school in various activities whether through volunteering
or organising the school's initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>What We Do</strong>
</p>
<p>We are committed to supporting the holistic growth and development of
our children/ward through the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Engagement of Parents: </strong>These engagement sessions provide
valuable insights into parenting, managing and supporting youth development
at different juncture of their secondary years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Supporting School Events and Programmes: </strong>Our PSG members
volunteer their time and resources to ensure the success of these events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building a Strong Parent Community: </strong>We provide opportunities
for parents to network, share experiences, and form lasting friendships.
We believe that when parents are connected and engaged, it enhances the
school environment for everyone.</p>

<p>Parents lay the foundation of moral values for students and the development
of character and citizenship in our students is greatly influenced by what
happens in school and at home.</p>
<p>Hence, there must be active partnerships between school and home so that
what is taught and learnt in school is reinforced at home. The learning
of values, skills and competencies will be more effective and enriching
for our students if there is alignment between what is taught in school
and what is practised at home.</p>
<p>At Bendemeer Secondary School, we believe in forging a partnership with
parents in order to raise a well-adjusted and resilient child. By participating
in school events and activities organised by PSG, you will find that your
participation and contributions extend beyond developing your child holistically.
You may also impact other students in this crucial developmental life stage
and the experience is truly a rewarding one.</p>
