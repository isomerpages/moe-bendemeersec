# Vice Principal Mr Azman's Message

![Vice Principal 2](/images/Aboutus/VP2.jpg)

In Bendemeer, every student gets a chance to shine through his/her passion over the 4/5 years. Throughout this journey, students hones important life skills that prepare them for the ever-changing challenges that come their way. At the same time, our students school experiences keep them grounded on values that enable them to navigate through life, and especially the evolving digital social world.

I am extremely excited to be part of the Bendemeer Family, and doing my bit in journeying with staff and students, to keep the school flag flying high. There is so much that the school has accomplished in recent years and there is every reason for this trajectory to continue.

Notwithstanding disruptions in the past 2 years, students have continued to benefit from the key programmes carried out in the school. I see this continuing albeit on a new normal playing field. There will still be many opportunities for students to build their character, nurture their learning and remain connected with the community, through service. Opportunities in school, coupled with partnership with parents and other stakeholders, provide the ideal platform for our students to achieve his/her potential through each individualâ€™s strengths.

There is every reason to be optimistic knowing that the team of staff remain in top gear in ensuring opportunities provided by the school will see students be Active Learners, Responsible Citizens.

With that, welcome to Bendemeer Secondary School, and I look forward to journey 2022 with all of you, to see every student living through the motto, From Each His Best!
