# Vice Principal Mr Ho's Message

![Vice Principal](/images/Aboutus/VP1.jpg)

A warm welcome to Bendemeer Secondary School.



The pandemic has completely disrupted and changed the way we live our lives. Its impact on all sectors and industries will be felt for decades to come. We must prepare our children to be ready for this future. Our school’s vision of “Active Learners, Responsible Citizens” is more compelling than ever before - Beyond mastery of knowledge, we will equip our students with skills and competencies that will enable them to navigate their future and thrive.  



More importantly, beyond individual achievements, we will help our students develop a strong moral compass so that they can do well by doing good to others. Our CCE Curriculum continues to improve and adapt to make the learning experiences more authentic, relevant and purposeful.



We are confident in our endeavours as we have a team of passionate teachers who shares the same philosophy as the school. They seek to build positive relationships with our students and create a caring environment that promotes positive student well-being. I encourage you to take some time to visit the [department pages](/departments/language-and-humanities/english-language-and-literature) and you will have a deeper appreciation of our commitment through the respective Head of Department’s messages.



As we move into each new year, we must have the healthy optimism and be open to new possibilities and experiences. I am committed to journey with each and everyone in the Bendemeer family to nurture every Bendemeerian to realise his/her potential. We will move forward as one and live out our school motto – “From Each His Best” every single day.



We are very grateful to parents and community partners for your unwavering support, care and commitment to our students.



I wish everyone an uplifting year ahead!
