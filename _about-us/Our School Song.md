<br><em>Lyrics by Teachers of Bendemeer Secondary School</em>
</p>
<p>Bendemeer, a beacon in our lives,
<br>where we live in perfect harmony,
<br>Bendemeer, always in our hearts,
<br>It's our home that we love andcherish.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>From each his best,
<br>we will do no less,
<br>we will take things in our stride,
<br>Bendemeer, forever you'll be our pride.</p>
<p>Bendemeerians, learners for life,
<br>we can make a difference in this age,
<br>we are willing to work and serve,
<br>for our family school and nation.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>From each his best,
<br>we will do no less,
<br>we will take things in our stride,
<br>Bendemeer, forver you'll be our pride.</p>
