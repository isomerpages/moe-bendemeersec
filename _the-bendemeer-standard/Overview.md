<p><strong>The Bendemeer Standards</strong> outlines the school rules, expectations
and code of conduct for all students to adhere to in order to contribute
to a conducive and purposeful learning environment in and outside school.
It defines the highest standards of behaviour and decorum so that there
is discipline and order in the overall school tone.</p>
<p>Character is built through order and discipline. Our students thrive when
they are (<strong>B</strong>e) anchored in values, <strong>D</strong>are
to aspire, <strong>M</strong>otivate one another and <strong>S</strong>trengthen
their strengths. Self-discipline empowers our students to stay focused
on their life goals, enhance personal confidence and build stronger personal
