<p><strong><u>Information on ‘N’ Level Results Collection on 18 Dec 2025</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Dear Bendemeerians and Parents/Guardians of the 2025 Graduating Cohort,</p>
<p>MOE and SEAB have recently announced that the GCE N-Level Examination
results will be released on&nbsp;<strong>Thursday, 18 December 2025</strong> at
2pm. Bendemeerians who are reporting to school for the collection of their
‘N’ Level results are to report to the <strong><u>school hall by 1.45 pm</u></strong> and
parents/guardians are welcome to join us.</p>
<p>All Bendemeerians are reminded to be properly groomed and dressed in their
school attire. Those who are not dressed in accordance with our Bendemeer
Standards will not be allowed to enter the school for the release of results.</p>
<p>Bendemeerians who are unable to collect their results in person should
inform the school before 18 Dec 2025 through their Form Teacher and can
appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results on their behalf.
Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents (Photo ID for identification)
for the school’s verification when collecting the results.</p>
