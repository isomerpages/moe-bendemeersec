Blended Learning is part of MOE’s efforts to further develop our students’ ability to be self-directed, passionate and lifelong learners. **Home-Based Learning** (**HBL**) takes place on **Even Week Fridays** and students will learn from home using their Personal Learning Device (PLD). Secondary 1 students who have not received their PLD yet and do not have a computing device at home may loan one from the school first. 

Students will also be engaged in Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) where they can explore their interests beyond the curriculum.
