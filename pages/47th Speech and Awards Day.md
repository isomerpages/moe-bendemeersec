<p>On 26 April, we celebrated Bendemeer Secondary School’s 47th Speech &amp;
Awards Day! With our Chairman of the school’s Alumni, Mr Delane Lim, gracing
the occasion as our Guest of Honour, we spent a delightful morning celebrating
the achievements of past and current present Bendemeerians. At the same
time, we extended our appreciation to our distinguished partners, thankful
for the strong relationships we have established with our stakeholders.</p>
<p>Our Concert Band started the event by playing a few rousing pieces that
set celebratory atmosphere, while the Choir members dazzled with not just
their melodious voices but with equally colourful ethnic costumes. Not
to be outdone, our Indian dancers, and later our Modern Dance members,
wowed the audience with mesmerising displays of immaculately choreographed
steps and coordination.</p>
<p>Apart from these outstanding performances from our performing arts groups,
the school was also treated to the official opening of our newly painted
parade square with a livestream of a tchoukball exhibition. The day ended
with a reception at our newly renovated library, and our guests were enthralled
by the musical talents of our three student performers who gave rousing
renditions of nostalgic classics!</p>
