# PLD for Sec 1 (2022)

## School-based Helpdesk

The ICT Department will provide technical support to students.    This is part of our efforts to ensure that there is minimum disruption to studentsâ€™ learning.  

There will be a fortnightly collection of faulty devices that will be sent via courier to the authorised service centre for repairs. The devices sent through the school may take between 3-4 weeks for repairs, depending on the extent of the damage.
