<p><strong><u>Information on ‘O’ Level Results Collection on 14 January 2026</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Dear Bendemeerians and Parents/Guardians of the 2025 Graduating Cohort,</p>
<p>MOE and SEAB have recently announced that the GCE O-Level Examination
results will be released on&nbsp;Wednesday, 14 January 2026 at 2pm. Bendemeerians
who are reporting to school for the collection of their ‘O’ Level results
are to report to the <strong><u>school hall by 1.45 pm</u></strong> and parents/guardians
are welcome to join us. This year, we are pleased to share that we are
hosting some media presence in our school hall during the results release.</p>
<p>All Bendemeerians are reminded to be <strong>properly groomed and dressed in their full school uniform</strong> with
shirts and blouses tucked in. Those who are not dressed in accordance with
our <a href="https://www.bendemeersec.moe.edu.sg/files/Forparents/Our_Bendemeer_Standards_2026.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Bendemeer Standards</a> will <u>not</u> be
allowed to enter the school for the release of results.</p>
<p>Bendemeerians who are unable to collect their results in person should
inform the school before 14 January 2026 through their Form Teacher and
can appoint a proxy to collect the physical copy of their results on their
behalf. Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents (Photo ID
for identification) for the school’s verification when collecting the results.</p>
