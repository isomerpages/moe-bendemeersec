<p style="text-align:justify">The study of Design & Technology (D&T) at Bendemeer Secondary School emphasizes the following:</p>

* <p style="text-align:justify">Stimulation of students’ thinking through sketching to generate and develop design solutions</p>
* <p style="text-align:justify">Exploration and experimentation of ideas through mock-ups so as to allow students to seek a practical and appropriate design solution for the identified user </p>
* Making of the prototype as a cognitive and hands-on endeavour
 
**Lower Secondary D&T**

<p style="text-align:justify">The lower secondary D&T syllabus focuses on the development of freehand sketching through idea generation and development. Students will be guided through their 2D sketches using templates to build up their confidence in 3D sketches. Students will get to do a few design-and-make projects which allow them to tinker and experiment with to come up with an improved solution. Students will carry out simple primary and secondary research in their A3-sized journal as they work towards understanding and developing empathy towards their users. Students will get to model their initial ideas using cardboard and eventually work towards their prototype using a variety of materials such as wood, plastic and metal coupled with simple technology (mechanism or electronics). Secondary Two students will get to experiment with MicroBits and to create a suitable prototype.</p>

**Upper Secondary D&T**

<p style="text-align:justify">Upper Secondary students will undertake several pupil-driven open-ended design projects using Design Process as the learning platform. Students will participate in external competitions and seminars organised by Institute of Higher Learning (IHLs) to gain exposure. They will extend and deepen their prior working knowledge of Technology (Material, Workshop Processes, Structures, Mechanisms and Electronics) so that they will grow their confidence in sketching and making to create and innovate during their National Examination coursework. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">A combination of formative and summative assessments are meted out to assess students’ application of knowledge and skills and test them on their concepts learnt in D&T. These include a written paper and coursework.</p>
