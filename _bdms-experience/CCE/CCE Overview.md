<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), including National Education
(NE), and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), are integral to the holistic
development of our students, leading to positive life outcomes. CCE 2021
provides an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development
of values, character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions
in a coherent and holistic way.</p>
<h4><strong>CCE 2021 aims to develop in our students:&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>a) <strong>Good character</strong>: Have a sound moral compass and a strong
sense of right and wrong, think critically and ethically, be discerning
in judgment, take responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards
others and strive for excellence;&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) <strong>Resilience and social-emotional well-being</strong>: Have a
balanced sense of self, form healthy relationships, be resilient when faced
with challenges, find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude and
appreciation;&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) <strong>Future readiness</strong>: Have a sense of purpose in life,
develop the dispositions of adaptability and lifelong learning so as to
be able to navigate education and career pathways purposefully and take
on the challenges of the future, including the world of work and life;
and&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) <strong>Active citizenship</strong>: Develop a strong national identity
based on a sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in themselves
and the future, an awareness of the reality of Singapore’s vulnerabilities
and constraints, and the will to act on improving the lives of others,
and building a future for our nation.</p>
