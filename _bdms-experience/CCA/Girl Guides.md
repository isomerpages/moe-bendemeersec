<h4><strong>Our Girl Guides CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Bendemeer 1st Coy Girl Guides aims to help our girls discover and develop
their strengths, skills and fullest potential, to become impactful citizens
of the world. We want our girls to be courageous, have confidence and character
to shine in our world by serving others from the heart. Being a member
of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), Bendemeer
guides have opportunities to be involved in local and international communities.
Through numerous adventures and courses, we equip girls to be self- assured
and empower them with the necessary life skills to embrace the world and
build life-long friendships along the way.</p>
